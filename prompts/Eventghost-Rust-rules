0. Use trunk-based development with feature branches. When starting a new feature, create a new branch from the main branch.
1. Work on the code problem asked, implementing it without harming existing methods, Ask if unsure.
3. Keep a log of what you've learned in a file to increase retention.
4. Update readme.md and TODO.md with progress after completing features
5. Git workflow rules:
   - Avoid getting caught in a pager (git diff, git log, etc.) This is a windows machine, but use --no-pager when possible.
   - Write commit messages that are descriptive and concise. Length is not important, but clarity is.
   - include any information you might need to know later to prevent duplicate work.
6. Command execution rules:
   - Use semicolons or && for multiple commands instead of newlines
   - Escape special characters in command strings
   - Set appropriate flags to prevent interactive prompts
   - generally try to tee output to a file or pipe to a file.
