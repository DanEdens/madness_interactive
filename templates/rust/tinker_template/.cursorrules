0. Use trunk-based development with feature branches
1. Work on the code problem asked, implementing it without harming existing methods, Ask if unsure.
2. Run available tests (e.g. 'cargo test') and iterate until successful
3. Maintain a "Lessons Learned" section in readme.md
4. Update readme.md with progress after completing features
5. Git workflow rules:
   - Always append '| cat' to commands that might trigger a pager (git diff, git log, etc.)
   - Use --no-pager flag for git commands when possible
   - Keep commit messages single-line or use multiple -m flags
   - Include ticket/issue numbers in commit messages when applicable
   - Write detailed commit messages for future debugging reference
6. Command execution rules:
   - Avoid newlines in command strings
   - Use semicolons or && for multiple commands instead of newlines
   - Escape special characters in command strings
   - Set appropriate flags to prevent interactive prompts
