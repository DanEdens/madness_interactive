# The Mad Tinker's AI Laboratory 🧪

A collection of experimental tools for tinkering with AI models locally. Part of the Mad Tinker's Workshop series, focusing on privacy, control, and the art of AI experimentation.

## The Mad Tinker's Toolbox 🛠️

### 1. The Knowledge Extractor (`setup_rag.py`)
Your personal document dissection and reanimation system:
- Dissect and catalog local documents with surgical precision
- Embed knowledge fragments into a neural matrix
- Store memories in a local vault (ChromaDB)
- Query your collection using home-grown AI constructs

**Laboratory Use**: Perfect for experimenting with document vivisection and knowledge extraction.

### 2. The Neural Guardian (`setup_proxy.py`)
A protective barrier for your AI communications:
- Intercept and inspect neural transmissions
- Filter through local cognitive safeguards
- Quarantine potentially hazardous content
- Maintain laboratory containment protocols

**Laboratory Use**: Essential when dealing with external neural networks while maintaining specimen integrity.

### 3. The Memory Vault (`setup_knowledge.py`)
Your personal knowledge preservation system:
- Web specimen collection with containment protocols
- Automatic knowledge preservation procedures
- Structured memory crystallization
- Secure local archival storage

**Laboratory Use**: For building your own repository of preserved knowledge specimens.

### 4. The Neural Router (`setup_gateway.py`)
Advanced neural pathway management:
- Load distribution across multiple neural constructs
- Automatic failsafe protocols
- Response preservation mechanisms
- Performance enhancement procedures

**Laboratory Use**: When juggling multiple AI constructs in your experiments.

### 5. The Observation Chamber (`setup_monitoring.py`)
Monitor your creations with precision:
- Neural activity monitoring
- Response time analysis
- Resource consumption tracking
- Performance metrics collection

**Laboratory Use**: For keeping your experiments under careful observation.

### 6. The Specimen Processor (`setup_dataset.py`)
Data specimen management facility:
- Specimen format transmutation
- Purification and preprocessing
- Training/validation bifurcation
- Quality assurance protocols

**Laboratory Use**: When preparing specimens for neural adaptation procedures.

### 7. The Testing Chamber (`setup_evaluation.py`)
Rigorous construct evaluation facility:
- Standardized neural stress testing
- Performance threshold analysis
- Comparative specimen studies
- Quality metric extraction

**Laboratory Use**: For evaluating your neural constructs under controlled conditions.

### 8. The Neural Forge (`setup_finetuning.py`)
Neural construct customization laboratory:
- Specimen preparation protocols
- Training configuration matrices
- Performance monitoring arrays
- Model preservation procedures

**Laboratory Use**: When modifying neural constructs for specific experiments.

## Laboratory Prerequisites 🧬

- Python 3.8+ neural interface
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) neural construct containment system
- Sufficient quantum storage capacity for specimens and constructs

## Quick Start Guide 🧮

1. Enter the laboratory:
   ```bash
   cd tools
   ```

2. View available experimental procedures:
   ```bash
   make help
   ```

3. Initialize specific apparatus:
   ```bash
   make rag        # Activate Knowledge Extractor
   make proxy      # Deploy Neural Guardian
   make knowledge  # Initialize Memory Vault
   # ... additional procedures available
   ```

4. Or activate all systems:
   ```bash
   make all
   ```

## Configuration Protocols

Each apparatus generates its own `.env` configuration matrix. Modify these settings through:
1. Direct `.env` matrix manipulation
2. Command line parameter injection
3. Core protocol modifications

## Laboratory Best Practices 🧫

1. **Containment Protocols**:
   - Begin with locally contained neural constructs
   - Deploy the Neural Guardian for external communications
   - Maintain specimen isolation in local storage

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Monitor neural activity levels
   - Select appropriate construct sizes
   - Implement memory caching protocols

3. **Specimen Organization**:
   - Version control all specimens
   - Document all experimental procedures
   - Maintain clear specimen hierarchies

## Troubleshooting Guide 🔧

1. **General Malfunctions**:
   - Verify Ollama containment system status
   - Check neural interface integrity
   - Monitor quantum storage capacity

2. **Apparatus-Specific Issues**:
   - Consult individual apparatus documentation
   - Check experimental logs
   - Verify component dependencies
