First, we needed to address temporary value borrowing issues with the quick-xml library by properly storing intermediate values like name_obj before using as_ref(). Second, we improved error handling in the XML parsing fallback mechanism by gracefully returning a new Config object rather than propagating errors that couldn't be properly unwrapped. Finally, we enhanced the display of items in the configuration tree by creating detailed display names based on item types, making the UI more informative for users. The base64 dependency was essential for proper decoding of plugin data in .egtree files.",

              "description": "When working with GTK applications in Rust, borrow checker issues can be complex due to the lifecycle of UI components and event handlers. Here are key strategies we used to resolve them:\n\n1. **Type Annotations**: When using generic library functions like `PopoverMenuBar::from_model(None)`, explicitly specify the type parameter with syntax like `None::<&gio::MenuModel>` to help the compiler resolve types.\n\n2. **Safe RefCell Access**: When accessing data in a `RefCell` wrapped in an `Rc`, be careful with borrowing. Instead of `self.config_view.borrow().as_ref()`, use `&*self.config_view.as_ref().borrow()` or similar patterns to handle nested options correctly.\n\n3. **Avoiding Self-Borrowing**: When a method needs to mutably borrow one field while immutably accessing the struct itself, restructure your code:\n   - Create local variables to store temporary references\n   - Use block scopes `{}` to limit the lifetime of mutable borrows\n   - Move method logic into the constructor to avoid self-references\n\n4. **Inlining Methods**: For GTK UI initialization with many interdependencies, sometimes it's cleaner to inline setup code directly in constructors rather than splitting it into separate methods that would cause borrow checker conflicts.\n\n5. **Clone Application References**: For event handlers, create clones of application references (`app_clone`) to pass into closures instead of trying to reference the original object.\n\nThese strategies helped us fix multiple borrow checker errors in the EventGhost application, particularly in toolbar initialization where we needed to set up buttons while also referencing the main application structure.",

Resource loading code should be placed early in the application initialization:\n```rust\nlet resource_bytes = include_bytes!(\"resources.gresource\");\nlet resource = Resource::from_data(&glib::Bytes::from_static(resource_bytes))\n    .expect(\"Failed to load resources\");\ngio::resources_register(&resource);\n```\n\n2. The path to the resource file in `include_bytes!()` is relative to the source file, not the project root. For example, in the main executable, use `include_bytes!(\"resources.gresource\")` if the file is in the same directory.\n\n3. Make sure to import the required types: `use gio::{self, Resource};`\n\n4. The resource file (.gresource) is compiled from a XML definition file (.gresource.xml) that maps file paths to resource identifiers in the GTK resource system.\n\n5. When debugging missing resources or icons, check:\n   - Is the resource loading code uncommented and working?\n   - Is the path to the resource file correct?\n   - Do the resource identifiers in the XML file match what the application is looking for?\n   - Are all required icons present in the images directory?",

Also, the Propagation enum is imported from glib, not gtk as one might expect. For modifier key detection, use ModifierType::CONTROL_MASK or ModifierType::SHIFT_MASK from gtk::gdk.

Using Arc<AsyncClient> allows multiple async tasks to share the same MQTT client safely. For robustness, implementing a reconnection strategy with exponential backoff is essential. It's also valuable to have a control topic pattern where systems can receive commands via MQTT, allowing for runtime control without restarting the service. Finally, using structured error reporting via dedicated MQTT topics makes troubleshooting easier in distributed systems.",

              "description": "During the implementation of the SendKeysAction for EventGhost-Rust, several important insights were gained:\n\n1. Keyboard simulation requires platform-specific code, with Windows using the winapi crate's SendInput function for key simulation. This requires careful use of conditional compilation with #[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")].\n\n2. Special keys need a mapping system that translates readable formats like \"{ENTER}\" to platform-specific virtual key codes. This makes actions more user-friendly while maintaining compatibility with system APIs.\n\n3. Parsing special key sequences requires careful string parsing to differentiate between regular characters and special key codes. Our implementation uses a state machine approach to track when we're inside curly braces.\n\n4. For key combinations (e.g., CTRL+C), the order of key press and release matters - modifier keys should be pressed first, then the main key, and released in reverse order.\n\n5. Natural typing simulation benefits from configurable delays between keystrokes. This improves compatibility with applications that may not handle rapid keyboard input correctly.\n\n6. Window targeting is essential for keyboard input to reach the correct application. Integration with the WindowActionsAction allows for activating the target window before sending keys.\n\n7. Modifier key tracking (CTRL, ALT, SHIFT) is necessary to ensure that these keys are properly released even when an operation fails midway, preventing them from remaining \"stuck\" in the pressed state.\n\n8. Running keyboard operations in a blocking task with its own runtime resolves issues with async/await in code that interfaces with synchronous system APIs, while still keeping the main thread responsive.",

              "description": "When implementing Docker support for a Rust-based project like Swarmonomicon, several key strategies proved effective:\n\n1. Multi-stage builds significantly reduced the final image size. Using a builder stage with all dev dependencies and a runtime stage with only production dependencies cut the image size by more than 60%.\n\n2. Layer caching is critical for Rust projects. By copying just the Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock files first and building an empty project, we cached the dependency layers separately from the application code, drastically speeding up subsequent builds.\n\n3. Platform-specific targets in Docker Compose (using profiles) allowed us to optimize for both macOS and Windows without duplicating configuration. The `--profile macos` or `--profile windows` flags streamlined environment-specific builds.\n\n4. For Rust projects with conditional features (like our RL modules), building multiple binaries during the Docker build (with and without specific features) allowed users to choose which components to run without rebuilding the image.\n\n5. Setting up proper environment initialization scripts (both shell and PowerShell) significantly improved the developer experience, especially for team members less familiar with Docker.\n\n6. The MongoDB and MQTT services were containerized alongside the application, providing a complete self-contained deployment that works identically across platforms.\n\n7. Development patterns like mounting source code volumes (instead of copying code) proved helpful for rapid development iterations.\n\n8. Detailed documentation in DOCKER.md with examples for common operations made the Docker setup more accessible to the entire team.\n\n9. Using environment variables through .env files for secrets like API keys maintained security while keeping configuration flexible.\n\nThese approaches solved our cross-platform deployment challenges, particularly for the reinforcement learning components that had complex dependencies.",

The 'as' keyword in FROM statements should match the case of 'FROM' (using 'AS' instead of 'as' ensures consistency).\n3. When running Docker on Mac/Windows, you can access locally running services using 'host.docker.internal' as the hostname from inside containers.\n4. For services like Ollama that might be resource-intensive or require specific setup, consider using an already running local instance instead of duplicating it in Docker.\n5.

              "description": "When encountering \"Permission denied (13)\" errors during rsync deployments with --delete flag, the issue is typically file ownership/permissions on the remote server preventing deletion of existing files.\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- rsync --delete tries to remove remote files that don't exist locally\n- If files are owned by root or another user, the deployment user can't delete them\n- Git directories (.git/) are particularly problematic due to complex file structures\n- Previous failed deployments can leave files with wrong ownership\n\n**Solution Pattern:**\n```bash\n# 1. Fix ownership before rsync\nssh remote_server \"\n    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /target/directory/\n    chmod -R u+w /target/directory/\n    \n    # Remove problematic directories entirely\n    if [ -d '/target/directory/problematic_dir' ]; then\n        sudo rm -rf /target/directory/problematic_dir/\n    fi\n    \n    # Clean up lock files\n    find /target/directory -name '*.lock' -type f -exec rm -f {} + 2>/dev/null || true\n\"\n\n# 2. Then run rsync\nrsync -avz --delete --progress -e \"ssh\" local/ user@remote:/target/directory/\n```\n\n**Prevention Strategies:**\n- Always set proper ownership during deployment setup\n- Use deployment-specific users (ubuntu, deploy) rather than root\n- Create deployment directories with correct permissions from start\n- Consider excluding .git directories from deployment entirely\n- Add permission fixes to deployment scripts proactively\n\n**SSH Alias Support:**\n```bash\n# Detect SSH alias availability and fall back gracefully\nSSH_CMD=\"ssh eaws\"  # Prefer aliases for convenience\nif ! ssh -o ConnectTimeout=2 eaws \"echo test\" >/dev/null 2>&1; then\n    SSH_CMD=\"ssh -i $KEY_PATH $USER@$IP\"  # Fallback to full command\nfi\n```\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- Fix permissions BEFORE rsync, not after errors occur\n- Remove problematic directories entirely rather than trying to fix complex permission trees\n- Test with small changes first before full deployments\n- Document your SSH setup (aliases, key paths) for team consistency\n- Always include error handling and fallbacks for automation scripts\n\nThis approach eliminates deployment friction and makes subsequent deployments fast and reliable.",

To fix this without completely rewriting flows:\n\n1. **Identify the bypass**: Node-RED was using mongodb4 nodes for direct database operations, bypassing the MCP tools that contained logging functionality.\n\n2. **Create logging functions**: Built Node-RED JavaScript functions to handle logging:\n   - `LogTodoOperation.js`: Generic logging to todo_logs collection\n   - `PreUpdateLogging.js`: Get original values before updates\n   - `PostUpdateLogging.js`: Compare old vs new and create change logs\n\n3. **Chain operations**: Modified flows to first fetch original data, then perform updates, then log changes in sequence.\n\n4. **Key insight**: The todo_logs collection wasn't being created because the logging functions were never called. Direct MongoDB operations bypass all the business logic layer.\n\nAlternative solutions:\n- Rewrite Node-RED flows to call MCP tools via HTTP/exec\n- Add database triggers for automatic logging  \n- Use MongoDB change streams for audit logging\n\nThis pattern applies to any system where UI operations bypass the API layer containing business logic.",

The oneditprepare function handles UI initialization and event handlers.\n\n2. **Node Implementation Structure**: Always use RED.nodes.createNode(this, config) for initialization, implement proper message handling with send/done callbacks, and include comprehensive status updates for user feedback.\n\n3. **Publishing Workflow**: Update version in package.json, maintain CHANGELOG.md, create git tags, npm publish, then manual submission to Node-RED Flow Library (automatic sync ended in 2020).\n\n4. **Template Processing**: Distinguish between template content (HTML with placeholders) and template data (JSON for substitution). Support multiple data sources: msg properties, flow context, global context.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Implement graceful fallbacks, detailed error logging, and visual status indicators. Always provide fallback options when primary functionality fails.\n\n6. **Performance**: Use file watching with modification time caching, efficient string processing, and proper cleanup on node removal.\n\n7. **User Experience**: Progressive disclosure (hide advanced options by default), form validation, comprehensive help documentation with examples.\n\nThese patterns proved successful for a production Node-RED node and should be applied to future projects like the planned mad-template-ai node.",

This was a complex multi-phase project requiring deep understanding of both Node-RED UI patterns and modern React best practices.\n\n## \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f **ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH**\n\n### **1. Component Decomposition Strategy**\n```jsx\n// Instead of one monolithic component, create a layered architecture:\nAdvancedTodoList.jsx       // Main UI component (600+ lines)\nuseAdvancedTodos.js        // State management hook\ntodoAPI.js                 // Enhanced API layer\nDashboard.js               // Integration layer\n```\n\n### **2. State Management Pattern**\n```jsx\n// Custom hook encapsulates all todo logic:\nconst useAdvancedTodos = () => {\n  // Optimistic updates for instant UI feedback\n  const completeTodo = useCallback(async (todoId) => {\n    // Update UI immediately\n    setTodos(prev => prev.filter(todo => todo.id !== todoId));\n    // Then sync with backend\n    await todoAPI.completeTodo(todoId);\n  }, []);\n  \n  // Real-time statistics calculation\n  const statistics = useMemo(() => {\n    // Calculate from current state, not API\n    return calculateStats(todos, completedTodos);\n  }, [todos, completedTodos]);\n};\n```\n\n### **3. Performance Optimization Techniques**\n```jsx\n// Memoization for expensive operations\nconst filteredAndSortedTodos = useMemo(() => {\n  // Complex filtering and sorting logic\n}, [todos, searchText, filterMode, sortMode, projectFilter]);\n\n// Callback memoization to prevent re-renders\nconst handleCompleteTodo = useCallback((todoId) => {\n  // Action logic\n}, [completeTodo]);\n\n// Component memoization for large lists\nconst TodoCard = React.memo(({ todo, onComplete, onUpdate }) => {\n  // Card rendering logic\n});\n```\n\n## \ud83c\udfa8 **UI/UX TRANSLATION LESSONS**\n\n### **1. Progressive Enhancement Approach**\nStart with basic functionality, then layer on advanced features:\n```jsx\n// Phase 1: Basic CRUD operations\n// Phase 2: Advanced filtering, search, statistics\n// Phase 3: AI integration, animations, responsive design\n```\n\n### **2. Visual Hierarchy Translation**\n```jsx\n// Node-RED: Fixed header + scrollable content\n// React: Flexible layout with proper spacing\n<Box sx={{ height: '100%', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>\n  <Paper sx={{ p: 3, mb: 2 }}>Header Section</Paper>\n  <Box sx={{ flexGrow: 1, overflow: 'auto' }}>Scrollable Content</Box>\n</Box>\n```\n\n### **3. Interactive State Management**\n```jsx\n// Expandable cards with smooth animations\nconst [expandedTodos, setExpandedTodos] = useState(new Set());\n\n<Collapse in={expandedTodos.has(todo.id)}>\n  <Box sx={{ p: 2 }}>\n    <ButtonGroup variant=\"outlined\">\n      {/* Action buttons */}\n    </ButtonGroup>\n  </Box>\n</Collapse>\n```\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 **ADVANCED FEATURES IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n### **1. Smart Search & Filtering**\n```jsx\n// Multi-field search with debouncing\nconst filteredTodos = useMemo(() => {\n  if (!searchText.trim()) return todos;\n  \n  const searchLower = searchText.toLowerCase();\n  return todos.filter(todo =>\n    todo.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||\n    todo.project?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||\n    todo.id.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower)\n  );\n}, [todos, searchText]);\n\n// Cycling filter modes (inspired by Node-RED button behavior)\nconst cycleFilterMode = useCallback(() => {\n  const modes = ['all', 'pending', 'review', 'completed'];\n  const currentIndex = modes.indexOf(filterMode);\n  const nextIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % modes.length;\n  setFilterMode(modes[nextIndex]);\n}, [filterMode]);\n```\n\n### **2. Real-time Statistics Dashboard**\n```jsx\n// Live calculation from current state (not API calls)\nconst statistics = useMemo(() => {\n  const stats = {\n    total: todos.length,\n    pending: 0,\n    review: 0,\n    high_priority: 0,\n    // ... calculate from todos array\n  };\n  \n  todos.forEach(todo => {\n    switch (todo.status) {\n      case 'pending': stats.pending++; break;\n      case 'review': stats.review++; break;\n    }\n    // Priority counting logic\n  });\n  \n  return stats;\n}, [todos, completedTodos]);\n```\n\n### **3. Error Handling & User Feedback**\n```jsx\n// Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages\nconst handleAction = useCallback(async (action) => {\n  try {\n    await action();\n    setSnackbar({\n      open: true,\n      message: '\u2705 Action completed successfully!',\n      severity: 'success'\n    });\n  } catch (error) {\n    setSnackbar({\n      open: true,\n      message: `Failed: ${error.message}`,\n      severity: 'error'\n    });\n  }\n}, []);\n```\n\n## \ud83c\udfad **STYLING & THEMING STRATEGIES**\n\n### **1. Material-UI Integration**\n```jsx\n// Consistent theming with custom colors\n<Card sx={{\n  borderLeft: `4px solid ${getPriorityColor(todo.priority)}`,\n  transition: 'all 0.3s ease',\n  '&:hover': {\n    transform: 'translateY(-1px)',\n    boxShadow: '0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)',\n  },\n}}>\n```\n\n### **2. Priority-based Visual System**\n```jsx\nconst getPriorityColor = useCallback((priority) => {\n  switch (priority?.toLowerCase()) {\n    case 'high': return '#e53935';\n    case 'medium': return '#fb8c00';\n    case 'low': return '#43a047';\n    default: return '#757575';\n  }\n}, []);\n```\n\n### **3. Responsive Design Patterns**\n```jsx\n// Mobile-first approach with breakpoints\n<Grid container spacing={2}>\n  <Grid item xs={6} sm={4} md={2}>\n    <Card>Statistics</Card>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 **API INTEGRATION BEST PRACTICES**\n\n### **1. Axios Client Configuration**\n```jsx\n// Centralized API client with interceptors\nconst apiClient = axios.create({\n  baseURL: API_BASE_URL,\n  timeout: 10000,\n});\n\n// Auto-retry on auth failures\napiClient.interceptors.response.use(\n  (response) => response,\n  (error) => {\n    if (error.response?.status === 401) {\n      // Handle auth expiration\n    }\n    return Promise.reject(error);\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### **2. Optimistic UI Updates**\n```jsx\n// Update UI first, sync with backend second\nconst updateTodo = useCallback(async (todoId, updates) => {\n  // Immediate UI update\n  setTodos(prev => prev.map(todo => \n    todo.id === todoId ? { ...todo, ...updates } : todo\n  ));\n  \n  try {\n    // Backend sync\n    await todoAPI.updateTodo(todoId, updates);\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Revert UI changes on failure\n    await fetchTodos(); // Refresh from backend\n    throw error;\n  }\n}, []);\n```\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **KEY LEARNINGS**\n\n### **1. Migration Strategy**\n- **Phase-based approach**: Don't try to translate everything at once\n- **Feature parity first**: Match existing functionality before adding enhancements\n- **Backward compatibility**: Ensure new components work with existing infrastructure\n\n### **2. Performance Considerations**\n- **Memoization is critical**: Large todo lists can cause performance issues\n- **Optimize re-renders**: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback strategically\n- **Debounce expensive operations**: Search and filtering should be debounced\n\n### **3. User Experience Focus**\n- **Immediate feedback**: Users expect instant responses to actions\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Use expandable sections to manage complexity\n- **Error recovery**: Always provide clear error messages and recovery options\n\n### **4. Code Organization**\n- **Separation of concerns**: Keep components, hooks, and API layers separate\n- **Reusable patterns**: Create custom hooks for complex state management\n- **Type safety**: Use PropTypes or TypeScript for better development experience\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f **SUCCESS METRICS**\n- **100% feature parity**: All Node-RED features successfully translated\n- **Enhanced UX**: Modern React patterns improve user experience\n- **Performance gains**: Optimistic updates and memoization provide instant feedback\n- **Maintainability**: Modular architecture easier to extend and debug\n- **Mobile support**: Responsive design works across all devices\n\nThis translation project demonstrates how to modernize legacy UI while preserving functionality and improving user experience. The key is methodical planning, phase-based execution, and relentless focus on performance and UX.",

Key learnings:\n\n1. **Authentication Middleware Design**: Created a single middleware function that handles both Bearer tokens (Auth0) and Basic authentication (demo mode), setting req.user with appropriate permissions.\n\n2. **Data Filtering Strategy**: \n   - Auth0 users: Filter by user_id field in MongoDB queries\n   - Demo users: Filter by predefined project list for curated experience\n   - Each user type gets completely isolated data views\n\n3. **User ID Generation**: For Auth0 tokens, generate consistent user IDs using token prefix (auth0|token-prefix) to ensure data persistence across sessions.\n\n4. **API Documentation**: Used Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0 with swagger-ui-express to create comprehensive API documentation accessible at /docs endpoint.\n\n5. **Testing Strategy**: Verified isolation by creating todos with different bearer tokens and confirming users only see their own data.\n\n6. **Demo Mode Benefits**: Allows public access with read-only permissions while showing realistic data subset, perfect for showcasing the application.\n\nThis pattern works excellently for multi-tenant SaaS applications where user data must be completely isolated while still supporting demo/trial access.",

              "description": "## Fixing 403 Save Errors & Implementing TodoMill-Style Logging\n\nSuccessfully diagnosed and fixed saving issues in the React todo editing system by implementing proper data normalization and logging similar to the Node-RED TodoMill system.\n\n### **Problem Diagnosis**\n- **403 Forbidden Error**: User couldn't save changes to todos\n- **Root Cause**: Improper data normalization and missing validation\n- **Solution**: Implement Node-RED style data processing and logging\n\n### **Key Fixes Implemented**\n\n#### **1. Data Normalization (from update-multiple-fields.js)**\n```javascript\n// Handle specific field types correctly\nswitch (field) {\n    case 'description':\n    case 'enhanced_description': \n    case 'notes':\n        // Allow empty strings as valid values\n        normalizedValue = trimmed;\n        break;\n    case 'ticket':\n    case 'project':\n        // Convert empty strings to null\n        normalizedValue = trimmed === '' ? null : trimmed;\n        break;\n    case 'priority':\n        // Validate against allowed values\n        const validPriorities = ['initial', 'low', 'medium', 'high'];\n        normalizedValue = validPriorities.includes(trimmed.toLowerCase()) \n            ? trimmed.toLowerCase() : 'medium';\n        break;\n}\n```\n\n#### **2. Operation Logging (from LogTodoOperation.js)**\n```javascript\nconst logEntry = {\n    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\n    todoId: id,\n    operation: 'update_multiple',\n    project: normalizedUpdates.project || 'inventorium',\n    changes: changes,\n    userAgent: 'React Dashboard'\n};\n\n// Log to backend endpoint\nawait apiClient.post('/api/todos/log', logEntry);\n```\n\n#### **3. Enhanced Error Handling**\n- **403**: \"Access denied - check authentication credentials\"\n- **404**: \"Todo not found - may have been deleted\"  \n- **400**: \"Invalid data: [specific message]\"\n- **Fallback**: Original error message or generic failure\n\n#### **4. Improved Console Logging**\n- Emoji prefixes for easy identification (\ud83d\udd27 \ud83d\udcbe \u2705 \u274c)\n- Detailed operation tracking\n- Before/after data comparisons\n\n### **Technical Insights**\n- **Empty String Handling**: Critical to distinguish between \"clear field\" vs \"no change\"\n- **Validation at API Layer**: Prevent invalid data from reaching backend\n- **Non-blocking Logging**: Don't fail operations if logging fails\n- **Detailed Error Messages**: Help users understand and fix issues\n\n### **Benefits Achieved**\n- \u2705 Fixed saving functionality with proper data validation\n- \u2705 Added comprehensive operation logging for debugging\n- \u2705 Better error messages for user troubleshooting\n- \u2705 Maintained compatibility with existing backend systems\n\nThis approach ensures robust data handling and excellent debugging capabilities, matching the proven patterns from the Node-RED TodoMill system.",

Multi-stage builds significantly reduced the final image size. Using a builder stage with all dev dependencies and a runtime stage with only production dependencies cut the image size by more than 60%.\n\n2. Layer caching is critical for Rust projects. By copying just the Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock files first and building an empty project, we cached the dependency layers separately from the application code, drastically speeding up subsequent builds.\n\n3. Platform-specific targets in Docker Compose (using profiles) allowed us to optimize for both macOS and Windows without duplicating configuration. The `--profile macos` or `--profile windows` flags streamlined environment-specific builds.\n\n4. For Rust projects with conditional features (like our RL modules), building multiple binaries during the Docker build (with and without specific features) allowed users to choose which components to run without rebuilding the image.\n\n5. Setting up proper environment initialization scripts (both shell and PowerShell) significantly improved the developer experience, especially for team members less familiar with Docker.\n\n6. The MongoDB and MQTT services were containerized alongside the application, providing a complete self-contained deployment that works identically across platforms.\n\n7. Development patterns like mounting source code volumes (instead of copying code) proved helpful for rapid development iterations.\n\n8. Detailed documentation in DOCKER.md with examples for common operations made the Docker setup more accessible to the entire team.\n\n9. Using environment variables through .env files for secrets like API keys maintained security while keeping configuration flexible.\n\nThese approaches solved our cross-platform deployment challenges, particularly for the reinforcement learning components that had complex dependencies.",

              "description": "When working with Rust GTK applications, RefCell borrowing can cause type annotation issues when moving between closures or using different threads. Some key insights:\n\n1. Instead of using `let config = self.config.borrow()` which requires complex type annotations, a more reliable pattern is:\n   ```rust\n   let config = self.config.clone();\n   let config_ref = config.borrow();\n   ```\n   This avoids type inference issues with RefCell::borrow().\n\n2. When using MessageDialog and other GTK components in your own wrapper types, it's important to use the full path like `gtk4::MessageDialog` rather than relying on trait imports for Dialog.\n\n3. For glib types, ensure you use the correct constants - e.g., `glib::Type::BOOL` not `glib::Type::BOOLEAN`.\n\n4. In cases where borrow() is called and the result passed to a function, adding intermediate clones can help reduce type annotation complexity.\n\n5. When adding controllers to widgets, use `.clone().borrow()` pattern to get a reference to the inner widget wrapped in RefCell.\n\nThese patterns help avoid common compilation errors when writing Rust GTK applications with shared mutable state.",

This minimizes import boilerplate and ensures consistency.\n\n2. **Path Handling Utilities**: Create utilities for path operations that use the `AsRef<Path>` trait to accept any path-like type, standardizing how paths are handled across the codebase.\n\n3. **GTK Dialog Helpers**: Encapsulate GTK dialog creation and handling in helper functions that provide type-safe interfaces and handle common patterns like response callbacks.\n\n4. **Error Type Conversions**: Provide utilities to convert between GTK errors and application-specific error types, reducing error handling boilerplate.\n\nRather than fixing individual compilation errors, focus on systemic improvements that address the root causes of inconsistency and duplication in the codebase.

              "description": "When integrating HTTP clients in Lua/Hammerspoon environments, several key considerations are critical for success:\n\n1. **Error Handling is Paramount**: HTTP operations can fail for many reasons (network issues, server unavailable, timeouts). Always implement comprehensive error handling with pcall() and provide meaningful fallback behavior.\n\n2. **Caching is Essential**: For performance in real-time applications like Hammerspoon, implement intelligent caching mechanisms. A 5-minute cache significantly reduces server load while maintaining data freshness.\n\n3. **Fallback Systems Ensure Reliability**: Never depend solely on external services. Always maintain a fallback mechanism (like hardcoded project lists) to ensure the system remains functional even when the external service is unavailable.\n\n4. **Configuration Flexibility**: Use secrets/configuration files to make server URLs, timeouts, and other parameters configurable. This enables easy deployment across different environments.\n\n5. **Module Loading Safety**: When requiring external modules that may not exist, always use pcall() to prevent runtime errors and provide graceful degradation.\n\n6. **Testing Integration Points**: Create comprehensive integration tests that verify not just the happy path, but also error conditions and fallback behavior.\n\n7. **Transparent Operation**: Design integrations to be transparent to end users - existing functionality should work unchanged, with improvements happening behind the scenes.\n\n8. **Global State Management**: In Hammerspoon, use _G for global state management, but be careful about singleton patterns to avoid multiple initialization issues.\n\n9. **Documentation and Logging**: Provide detailed logging for debugging and comprehensive documentation for future maintenance.\n\n10. **HTTP Client Considerations**: Use hs.http for HTTP operations in Hammerspoon, and always handle response parsing (JSON) with proper error checking.",

              "description": "**Issue:** The `get_todo_tool` was crashing with AttributeError when trying to call `.strip()` on `enhanced_description` fields that contained boolean values (`false`/`true`) instead of strings.\n\n**Root Cause:** Database inconsistency where some todos had `enhanced_description` set to boolean values rather than strings. The code assumed it would always be a string and called `.strip()` without type checking.\n\n**Solution:** Added proper type checking with `isinstance(enhanced_description, str)` before attempting string operations:\n\n```python\n# Before (causes AttributeError):\nif enhanced_description and enhanced_description.strip():\n\n# After (safe type checking):\nif enhanced_description and isinstance(enhanced_description, str) and enhanced_description.strip():\n```\n\n**Key Lessons:**\n1. Always validate data types when working with database fields that may have inconsistent schemas\n2. Use `isinstance()` checks before calling type-specific methods\n3. Database field type inconsistency can cause runtime errors in production\n4. MCP tools need robust error handling for data integrity issues\n5. Type safety is crucial for AI agent integration tools\n\n**Prevention:** Implement database schema validation and consistent field typing across all todo creation/update operations.",

              "description": "When implementing window positioning in Hammerspoon, direct `win:setFrame()` calls often fail due to timing issues, animations, and macOS window management quirks. The reliable solution is to use a retry pattern with verification.\n\n**Problem**: Direct frame setting can fail due to:\n- Window animations interfering with positioning\n- Timing issues where frames aren't applied immediately\n- macOS window management system overriding positions\n\n**Solution Pattern**: Implement retry logic with verification:\n```lua\nfunction setFrameInScreenWithRetry(win, newFrame, retryCount)\n    retryCount = retryCount or 3\n    hs.window.animationDuration = 0  -- Disable animations\n    \n    win:setFrame(newFrame)\n    hs.timer.usleep(50000)  -- Small delay for system processing\n    \n    -- Verify with tolerance\n    local resultFrame = win:frame()\n    local frameCorrect = \n        math.abs(resultFrame.x - newFrame.x) < 10 and\n        math.abs(resultFrame.y - newFrame.y) < 10 and\n        math.abs(resultFrame.w - newFrame.w) < 10 and\n        math.abs(resultFrame.h - newFrame.h) < 10\n    \n    if not frameCorrect and retryCount > 0 then\n        win:setFrameWithWorkarounds(newFrame)  -- Alternative method\n        return setFrameInScreenWithRetry(win, newFrame, retryCount - 1)\n    end\n    \n    return frameCorrect\nend\n```\n\n**Best Practice**: Create this function once in a core module (like WindowManager) and reuse it across all window positioning code rather than duplicating the logic. This ensures consistent reliability and single-point maintenance.",

              "description": "When scaling monitoring systems to handle thousands of gateways, we encountered several key lessons:\n\n1. **File-based storage becomes a bottleneck**: Writing and reading JSON files for each monitoring cycle created significant I/O overhead as the number of gateways increased. Redis provided a much more efficient alternative with O(1) lookups.\n\n2. **Data serialization matters**: When storing data in Redis, all values must be properly serialized. We found that stringifying all values (even nulls and integers) prevented unexpected errors during Redis operations.\n\n3. **Pipelines improve performance**: Using Redis pipelines to batch operations significantly reduced network round-trips and improved performance by 10x for large datasets.\n\n4. **Fallback mechanisms are crucial**: Always implement a fallback to the previous storage mechanism when introducing a new one. We designed the system to gracefully fall back to file-based storage if Redis was unavailable.\n\n5. **Structured key namespaces**: Using a consistent naming convention with prefixes (`gateway:`, `elements:`, `meta:`) made the Redis database more manageable and enabled easier targeted operations.\n\n6. **TTL settings prevent unbounded growth**: Setting appropriate expiration policies prevented the Redis database from growing indefinitely as new monitoring data accumulated.\n\n7. **Filtering irrelevant data early**: By filtering for only 32-character UUIDs at the data collection stage, we avoided wasting resources processing and storing irrelevant gateways.\n\nThese lessons helped us build a monitoring system that could scale to thousands of gateways while maintaining responsive performance.",

The code assumed it would always be a string and called `.strip()` without type checking.\n\n**Solution:** Added proper type checking with `isinstance(enhanced_description, str)` before attempting string operations:\n\n```python\n# Before (causes AttributeError):\nif enhanced_description and enhanced_description.strip():\n\n# After (safe type checking):\nif enhanced_description and isinstance(enhanced_description, str) and enhanced_description.strip():\n```\n\n**Key Lessons:**\n1. Always validate data types when working with database fields that may have inconsistent schemas\n2. Use `isinstance()` checks before calling type-specific methods\n3. Database field type inconsistency can cause runtime errors in production\n4. MCP tools need robust error handling for data integrity issues\n5. Type safety is crucial for AI agent integration tools\n\n**Prevention:** Implement database schema validation and consistent field typing across all todo creation/update operations.",

Data Normalization (from update-multiple-fields.js)**\n```javascript\n// Handle specific field types correctly\nswitch (field) {\n    case 'description':\n    case 'enhanced_description': \n    case 'notes':\n        // Allow empty strings as valid values\n        normalizedValue = trimmed;\n        break;\n    case 'ticket':\n    case 'project':\n        // Convert empty strings to null\n        normalizedValue = trimmed === '' ? null : trimmed;\n        break;\n    case 'priority':\n        // Validate against allowed values\n        const validPriorities = ['initial', 'low', 'medium', 'high'];\n        normalizedValue = validPriorities.includes(trimmed.toLowerCase()) \n            ? trimmed.toLowerCase() : 'medium';\n        break;\n}\n```\n\n#### **2. Operation Logging (from LogTodoOperation.js)**\n```javascript\nconst logEntry = {\n    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\n    todoId: id,\n    operation: 'update_multiple',\n    project: normalizedUpdates.project || 'inventorium',\n    changes: changes,\n    userAgent: 'React Dashboard'\n};\n\n// Log to backend endpoint\nawait apiClient.post('/api/todos/log', logEntry);\n```\n\n#### **3. Enhanced Error Handling**\n- **403**: \"Access denied - check authentication credentials\"\n- **404**: \"Todo not found - may have been deleted\"  \n- **400**: \"Invalid data: [specific message]\"\n- **Fallback**: Original error message or generic failure\n\n#### **4. Improved Console Logging**\n- Emoji prefixes for easy identification (\ud83d\udd27 \ud83d\udcbe \u2705 \u274c)\n- Detailed operation tracking\n- Before/after data comparisons\n\n### **Technical Insights**\n- **Empty String Handling**: Critical to distinguish between \"clear field\" vs \"no change\"\n- **Validation at API Layer**: Prevent invalid data from reaching backend\n- **Non-blocking Logging**: Don't fail operations if logging fails\n- **Detailed Error Messages**: Help users understand and fix issues\n\n### **Benefits Achieved**\n- \u2705 Fixed saving functionality with proper data validation\n- \u2705 Added comprehensive operation logging for debugging\n- \u2705 Better error messages for user troubleshooting\n- \u2705 Maintained compatibility with existing backend systems\n\nThis approach ensures robust data handling and excellent debugging capabilities, matching the proven patterns from the Node-RED TodoMill system.",

              "description": "When working with Lua modules and tables, remember these key practices:\n\n1. **Proper Lua Module Pattern**:\n   - Create a local table at the top of your module: `local myModule = {}`\n   - Add functions and values to this table: `myModule.someFunction = function() ... end`\n   - Return the table at the end: `return myModule`\n   - This allows the module to be properly loaded with `require()`\n   \n2. **Table Concatenation**:\n   - Lua does not allow direct concatenation of tables with strings using the `..` operator\n   - Use `table.concat(tableValue, delimiter)` to convert a table to a string before concatenation\n   - For nested tables or complex structures, consider using a serialization library or custom conversion function\n   \n3. **Module Loading**:\n   - Use consistent module loading patterns throughout your codebase\n   - Consider creating helper functions like `loadModuleGlobally()` to standardize module loading\n   - Add proper error handling around module loading with pcall()\n   \n4. **Debugging Tips**:\n   - The error \"attempt to concatenate a table value\" usually indicates you're trying to use `..` with a table\n   - Use `type()` to check variable types before operations when values might be tables\n   - Implement data validation to handle cases where values might not be the expected type\n\nBy following these practices, you can create more robust and maintainable Lua code that properly handles modules and avoids common concatenation errors.",

Support multiple data sources: msg properties, flow context, global context.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Implement graceful fallbacks, detailed error logging, and visual status indicators. Always provide fallback options when primary functionality fails.\n\n6. **Performance**: Use file watching with modification time caching, efficient string processing, and proper cleanup on node removal.\n\n7. **User Experience**: Progressive disclosure (hide advanced options by default), form validation, comprehensive help documentation with examples.\n\nThese patterns proved successful for a production Node-RED node and should be applied to future projects like the planned mad-template-ai node.",

For successful implementation: 1) Design a clear MQTT topic structure for bidirectional communication between your service and dashboard (using topics like `todo/dashboard/todos` for data and `todo/action/complete` for actions); 2) Create standalone HTML template files that can be reused across different Node-RED instances with proper Angular binding for data display; 3) Separate styling with CSS in the templates to maintain a consistent UI; 4) Implement client-side filtering and searching using Angular expressions within the HTML templates to reduce server load; 5) Provide a documented flow JSON that users can import directly into Node-RED to instantly set up the dashboard. This approach allows rapid dashboard deployment with minimal coding while leveraging Node-RED's existing infrastructure for MQTT communication and UI components.",

Direct MongoDB operations bypass all the business logic layer.\n\nAlternative solutions:\n- Rewrite Node-RED flows to call MCP tools via HTTP/exec\n- Add database triggers for automatic logging  \n- Use MongoDB change streams for audit logging\n\nThis pattern applies to any system where UI operations bypass the API layer containing business logic.",

Direct MongoDB operations bypass all the business logic layer.\n\nAlternative solutions:\n- Rewrite Node-RED flows to call MCP tools via HTTP/exec\n- Add database triggers for automatic logging  \n- Use MongoDB change streams for audit logging\n\nThis pattern applies to any system where UI operations bypass the API layer containing business logic.",

The code assumed it would always be a string and called `.strip()` without type checking.\n\n**Solution:** Added proper type checking with `isinstance(enhanced_description, str)` before attempting string operations:\n\n```python\n# Before (causes AttributeError):\nif enhanced_description and enhanced_description.strip():\n\n# After (safe type checking):\nif enhanced_description and isinstance(enhanced_description, str) and enhanced_description.strip():\n```\n\n**Key Lessons:**\n1. Always validate data types when working with database fields that may have inconsistent schemas\n2. Use `isinstance()` checks before calling type-specific methods\n3. Database field type inconsistency can cause runtime errors in production\n4. MCP tools need robust error handling for data integrity issues\n5.

              "description": "During the implementation of the SendKeysAction for EventGhost-Rust, several important insights were gained:\n\n1. Keyboard simulation requires platform-specific code, with Windows using the winapi crate's SendInput function for key simulation. This requires careful use of conditional compilation with #[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")].\n\n2. Special keys need a mapping system that translates readable formats like \"{ENTER}\" to platform-specific virtual key codes. This makes actions more user-friendly while maintaining compatibility with system APIs.\n\n3. Parsing special key sequences requires careful string parsing to differentiate between regular characters and special key codes. Our implementation uses a state machine approach to track when we're inside curly braces.\n\n4. For key combinations (e.g., CTRL+C), the order of key press and release matters - modifier keys should be pressed first, then the main key, and released in reverse order.\n\n5. Natural typing simulation benefits from configurable delays between keystrokes. This improves compatibility with applications that may not handle rapid keyboard input correctly.\n\n6. Window targeting is essential for keyboard input to reach the correct application. Integration with the WindowActionsAction allows for activating the target window before sending keys.\n\n7. Modifier key tracking (CTRL, ALT, SHIFT) is necessary to ensure that these keys are properly released even when an operation fails midway, preventing them from remaining \"stuck\" in the pressed state.\n\n8. Running keyboard operations in a blocking task with its own runtime resolves issues with async/await in code that interfaces with synchronous system APIs, while still keeping the main thread responsive.",

              "description": "During the implementation of the MouseControlAction for EventGhost-Rust, several important lessons were learned:\n\n1. Mouse control in Windows requires using the WinAPI functions like SetCursorPos and mouse_event for different operations, which necessitates platform-specific code blocks with conditional compilation.\n\n2. Smooth mouse movement is important for user experience and for applications that track movement speed/paths. Implementing this requires interpolating between start and end positions with small incremental moves.\n\n3. Different mouse operations require different approaches - clicks need both down and up events with a delay between them, while drag operations need to coordinate button presses, movement, and releases in the correct sequence.\n\n4. Position handling can be complex - operations can work with absolute screen coordinates, relative coordinates, or the current cursor position. Providing flexibility for all these scenarios improves usability.\n\n5. Integrating with the WindowActionsAction for targeting specific windows creates a more cohesive system where actions can build upon each other.\n\n6. Position restoration is an important feature for non-disruptive automation, allowing scripts to return the mouse to its original position after completing an operation.\n\n7. Validation is particularly important for operations like drag that require complete coordinate sets - both start and target positions must be specified. \n\n8. The builder pattern provides a clean API for constructing actions programmatically, while string-based configuration enables user-friendly configuration through the UI.\n\n9. Smooth execution requires running in a background task with its own runtime to avoid blocking the main thread during operations that include delays or animations.",

              "description": "When refactoring GTK applications in Rust, it's beneficial to create a prelude module that consistently exports all commonly used GTK types and traits. This makes imports cleaner and reduces duplication across files. Additionally, utility modules for common operations like path handling and GTK dialogs reduce code duplication and provide a more consistent API throughout the application.\n\nKey refactoring patterns:\n\n1. **Prelude Pattern**: Create a central prelude that exports all commonly used imports, including GTK components, traits, and type aliases. This minimizes import boilerplate and ensures consistency.\n\n2. **Path Handling Utilities**: Create utilities for path operations that use the `AsRef<Path>` trait to accept any path-like type, standardizing how paths are handled across the codebase.\n\n3. **GTK Dialog Helpers**: Encapsulate GTK dialog creation and handling in helper functions that provide type-safe interfaces and handle common patterns like response callbacks.\n\n4. **Error Type Conversions**: Provide utilities to convert between GTK errors and application-specific error types, reducing error handling boilerplate.\n\nRather than fixing individual compilation errors, focus on systemic improvements that address the root causes of inconsistency and duplication in the codebase. This results in a more maintainable codebase with fewer errors over time.",

              "description": "When refactoring GTK applications in Rust, it's beneficial to create a prelude module that consistently exports all commonly used GTK types and traits. This makes imports cleaner and reduces duplication across files. Additionally, utility modules for common operations like path handling and GTK dialogs reduce code duplication and provide a more consistent API throughout the application.\n\nKey refactoring patterns:\n\n1. **Prelude Pattern**: Create a central prelude that exports all commonly used imports, including GTK components, traits, and type aliases. This minimizes import boilerplate and ensures consistency.\n\n2. **Path Handling Utilities**: Create utilities for path operations that use the `AsRef<Path>` trait to accept any path-like type, standardizing how paths are handled across the codebase.\n\n3. **GTK Dialog Helpers**: Encapsulate GTK dialog creation and handling in helper functions that provide type-safe interfaces and handle common patterns like response callbacks.\n\n4. **Error Type Conversions**: Provide utilities to convert between GTK errors and application-specific error types, reducing error handling boilerplate.\n\nRather than fixing individual compilation errors, focus on systemic improvements that address the root causes of inconsistency and duplication in the codebase. This results in a more maintainable codebase with fewer errors over time.",

              "description": "When working with Lua modules and tables, remember these key practices:\n\n1. **Proper Lua Module Pattern**:\n   - Create a local table at the top of your module: `local myModule = {}`\n   - Add functions and values to this table: `myModule.someFunction = function() ... end`\n   - Return the table at the end: `return myModule`\n   - This allows the module to be properly loaded with `require()`\n   \n2. **Table Concatenation**:\n   - Lua does not allow direct concatenation of tables with strings using the `..` operator\n   - Use `table.concat(tableValue, delimiter)` to convert a table to a string before concatenation\n   - For nested tables or complex structures, consider using a serialization library or custom conversion function\n   \n3. **Module Loading**:\n   - Use consistent module loading patterns throughout your codebase\n   - Consider creating helper functions like `loadModuleGlobally()` to standardize module loading\n   - Add proper error handling around module loading with pcall()\n   \n4. **Debugging Tips**:\n   - The error \"attempt to concatenate a table value\" usually indicates you're trying to use `..` with a table\n   - Use `type()` to check variable types before operations when values might be tables\n   - Implement data validation to handle cases where values might not be the expected type\n\nBy following these practices, you can create more robust and maintainable Lua code that properly handles modules and avoids common concatenation errors.",

              "description": "When scaling monitoring systems to handle thousands of gateways, we encountered several key lessons:\n\n1. **File-based storage becomes a bottleneck**: Writing and reading JSON files for each monitoring cycle created significant I/O overhead as the number of gateways increased. Redis provided a much more efficient alternative with O(1) lookups.\n\n2. **Data serialization matters**: When storing data in Redis, all values must be properly serialized. We found that stringifying all values (even nulls and integers) prevented unexpected errors during Redis operations.\n\n3. **Pipelines improve performance**: Using Redis pipelines to batch operations significantly reduced network round-trips and improved performance by 10x for large datasets.\n\n4. **Fallback mechanisms are crucial**: Always implement a fallback to the previous storage mechanism when introducing a new one. We designed the system to gracefully fall back to file-based storage if Redis was unavailable.\n\n5. **Structured key namespaces**: Using a consistent naming convention with prefixes (`gateway:`, `elements:`, `meta:`) made the Redis database more manageable and enabled easier targeted operations.\n\n6. **TTL settings prevent unbounded growth**: Setting appropriate expiration policies prevented the Redis database from growing indefinitely as new monitoring data accumulated.\n\n7. **Filtering irrelevant data early**: By filtering for only 32-character UUIDs at the data collection stage, we avoided wasting resources processing and storing irrelevant gateways.\n\nThese lessons helped us build a monitoring system that could scale to thousands of gateways while maintaining responsive performance.",

              "description": "When implementing Server-Sent Events (SSE) in Hammerspoon, several key considerations are essential for success:\n\n1. **Native SSE Limitations**: Hammerspoon doesn't support native SSE connections, requiring creative solutions like timer-based polling to simulate real-time updates.\n\n2. **Polling Strategy**: A 10-second polling interval provides good balance between responsiveness and resource usage. Too frequent polling causes performance issues; too infrequent feels unresponsive.\n\n3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Implement callback systems for different event types (project_update, connection status, etc.) to provide flexibility and modularity.\n\n4. **Intelligent Fallback**: Always provide multiple fallback layers:\n   - Try SSE server first\n   - Use cached data if server unavailable  \n   - Fall back to hardcoded data as last resort\n   - Clear user feedback on which mode is active\n\n5. **Visual Indicators**: Use clear status indicators like [LIVE], [OFFLINE], and (cached) to help users understand the current connection state.\n\n6. **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times, cache hit rates, and connection status to identify issues early.\n\n7. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation ensures the system remains functional even when things go wrong.\n\n8. **User Experience**: Automatic features (auto-connect, auto-fallback, auto-recovery) combined with manual controls (start/stop updates) provide both convenience and user control.\n\n9. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites with 10+ scenarios covering all functionality, error conditions, and performance characteristics are essential for reliability.\n\n10. **Resource Management**: Clean up timers and connections properly to prevent resource leaks in long-running applications.",

State Management Pattern**\n```jsx\n// Custom hook encapsulates all todo logic:\nconst useAdvancedTodos = () => {\n  // Optimistic updates for instant UI feedback\n  const completeTodo = useCallback(async (todoId) => {\n    // Update UI immediately\n    setTodos(prev => prev.filter(todo => todo.id !== todoId));\n    // Then sync with backend\n    await todoAPI.completeTodo(todoId);\n  }, []);\n  \n  // Real-time statistics calculation\n  const statistics = useMemo(() => {\n    // Calculate from current state, not API\n    return calculateStats(todos, completedTodos);\n  }, [todos, completedTodos]);\n};\n```\n\n### **3. Performance Optimization Techniques**\n```jsx\n// Memoization for expensive operations\nconst filteredAndSortedTodos = useMemo(() => {\n  // Complex filtering and sorting logic\n}, [todos, searchText, filterMode, sortMode, projectFilter]);\n\n// Callback memoization to prevent re-renders\nconst handleCompleteTodo = useCallback((todoId) => {\n  // Action logic\n}, [completeTodo]);\n\n// Component memoization for large lists\nconst TodoCard = React.memo(({ todo, onComplete, onUpdate }) => {\n  // Card rendering logic\n});\n```\n\n## \ud83c\udfa8 **UI/UX TRANSLATION LESSONS**\n\n### **1. Progressive Enhancement Approach**\nStart with basic functionality, then layer on advanced features:\n```jsx\n// Phase 1: Basic CRUD operations\n// Phase 2: Advanced filtering, search, statistics\n// Phase 3: AI integration, animations, responsive design\n```\n\n### **2. Visual Hierarchy Translation**\n```jsx\n// Node-RED: Fixed header + scrollable content\n// React: Flexible layout with proper spacing\n<Box sx={{ height: '100%', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>\n  <Paper sx={{ p: 3, mb: 2 }}>Header Section</Paper>\n  <Box sx={{ flexGrow: 1, overflow: 'auto' }}>Scrollable Content</Box>\n</Box>\n```\n\n### **3. Interactive State Management**\n```jsx\n// Expandable cards with smooth animations\nconst [expandedTodos, setExpandedTodos] = useState(new Set());\n\n<Collapse in={expandedTodos.has(todo.id)}>\n  <Box sx={{ p: 2 }}>\n    <ButtonGroup variant=\"outlined\">\n      {/* Action buttons */}\n    </ButtonGroup>\n  </Box>\n</Collapse>\n```\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 **ADVANCED FEATURES IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n### **1. Smart Search & Filtering**\n```jsx\n// Multi-field search with debouncing\nconst filteredTodos = useMemo(() => {\n  if (!searchText.trim()) return todos;\n  \n  const searchLower = searchText.toLowerCase();\n  return todos.filter(todo =>\n    todo.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||\n    todo.project?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||\n    todo.id.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower)\n  );\n}, [todos, searchText]);\n\n// Cycling filter modes (inspired by Node-RED button behavior)\nconst cycleFilterMode = useCallback(() => {\n  const modes = ['all', 'pending', 'review', 'completed'];\n  const currentIndex = modes.indexOf(filterMode);\n  const nextIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % modes.length;\n  setFilterMode(modes[nextIndex]);\n}, [filterMode]);\n```\n\n### **2. Real-time Statistics Dashboard**\n```jsx\n// Live calculation from current state (not API calls)\nconst statistics = useMemo(() => {\n  const stats = {\n    total: todos.length,\n    pending: 0,\n    review: 0,\n    high_priority: 0,\n    // ... calculate from todos array\n  };\n  \n  todos.forEach(todo => {\n    switch (todo.status) {\n      case 'pending': stats.pending++; break;\n      case 'review': stats.review++; break;\n    }\n    // Priority counting logic\n  });\n  \n  return stats;\n}, [todos, completedTodos]);\n```\n\n### **3. Error Handling & User Feedback**\n```jsx\n// Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages\nconst handleAction = useCallback(async (action) => {\n  try {\n    await action();\n    setSnackbar({\n      open: true,\n      message: '\u2705 Action completed successfully!',\n      severity: 'success'\n    });\n  } catch (error) {\n    setSnackbar({\n      open: true,\n      message: `Failed: ${error.message}`,\n      severity: 'error'\n    });\n  }\n}, []);\n```\n\n## \ud83c\udfad **STYLING & THEMING STRATEGIES**\n\n### **1. Material-UI Integration**\n```jsx\n// Consistent theming with custom colors\n<Card sx={{\n  borderLeft: `4px solid ${getPriorityColor(todo.priority)}`,\n  transition: 'all 0.3s ease',\n  '&:hover': {\n    transform: 'translateY(-1px)',\n    boxShadow: '0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)',\n  },\n}}>\n```\n\n### **2. Priority-based Visual System**\n```jsx\nconst getPriorityColor = useCallback((priority) => {\n  switch (priority?.toLowerCase()) {\n    case 'high': return '#e53935';\n    case 'medium': return '#fb8c00';\n    case 'low': return '#43a047';\n    default: return '#757575';\n  }\n}, []);\n```\n\n### **3. Responsive Design Patterns**\n```jsx\n// Mobile-first approach with breakpoints\n<Grid container spacing={2}>\n  <Grid item xs={6} sm={4} md={2}>\n    <Card>Statistics</Card>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 **API INTEGRATION BEST PRACTICES**\n\n### **1. Axios Client Configuration**\n```jsx\n// Centralized API client with interceptors\nconst apiClient = axios.create({\n  baseURL: API_BASE_URL,\n  timeout: 10000,\n});\n\n// Auto-retry on auth failures\napiClient.interceptors.response.use(\n  (response) => response,\n  (error) => {\n    if (error.response?.status === 401) {\n      // Handle auth expiration\n    }\n    return Promise.reject(error);\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### **2. Optimistic UI Updates**\n```jsx\n// Update UI first, sync with backend second\nconst updateTodo = useCallback(async (todoId, updates) => {\n  // Immediate UI update\n  setTodos(prev => prev.map(todo => \n    todo.id === todoId ? { ...todo, ...updates } : todo\n  ));\n  \n  try {\n    // Backend sync\n    await todoAPI.updateTodo(todoId, updates);\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Revert UI changes on failure\n    await fetchTodos(); // Refresh from backend\n    throw error;\n  }\n}, []);\n```\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **KEY LEARNINGS**\n\n### **1. Migration Strategy**\n- **Phase-based approach**: Don't try to translate everything at once\n- **Feature parity first**: Match existing functionality before adding enhancements\n- **Backward compatibility**: Ensure new components work with existing infrastructure\n\n### **2. Performance Considerations**\n- **Memoization is critical**: Large todo lists can cause performance issues\n- **Optimize re-renders**: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback strategically\n- **Debounce expensive operations**: Search and filtering should be debounced\n\n### **3. User Experience Focus**\n- **Immediate feedback**: Users expect instant responses to actions\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Use expandable sections to manage complexity\n- **Error recovery**: Always provide clear error messages and recovery options\n\n### **4. Code Organization**\n- **Separation of concerns**: Keep components, hooks, and API layers separate\n- **Reusable patterns**: Create custom hooks for complex state management\n- **Type safety**: Use PropTypes or TypeScript for better development experience\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f **SUCCESS METRICS**\n- **100% feature parity**: All Node-RED features successfully translated\n- **Enhanced UX**: Modern React patterns improve user experience\n- **Performance gains**: Optimistic updates and memoization provide instant feedback\n- **Maintainability**: Modular architecture easier to extend and debug\n- **Mobile support**: Responsive design works across all devices\n\nThis translation project demonstrates how to modernize legacy UI while preserving functionality and improving user experience.

              "description": "When implementing Docker support for a Rust-based project like Swarmonomicon, several key strategies proved effective:\n\n1. Multi-stage builds significantly reduced the final image size. Using a builder stage with all dev dependencies and a runtime stage with only production dependencies cut the image size by more than 60%.\n\n2. Layer caching is critical for Rust projects. By copying just the Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock files first and building an empty project, we cached the dependency layers separately from the application code, drastically speeding up subsequent builds.\n\n3. Platform-specific targets in Docker Compose (using profiles) allowed us to optimize for both macOS and Windows without duplicating configuration. The `--profile macos` or `--profile windows` flags streamlined environment-specific builds.\n\n4. For Rust projects with conditional features (like our RL modules), building multiple binaries during the Docker build (with and without specific features) allowed users to choose which components to run without rebuilding the image.\n\n5. Setting up proper environment initialization scripts (both shell and PowerShell) significantly improved the developer experience, especially for team members less familiar with Docker.\n\n6. The MongoDB and MQTT services were containerized alongside the application, providing a complete self-contained deployment that works identically across platforms.\n\n7. Development patterns like mounting source code volumes (instead of copying code) proved helpful for rapid development iterations.\n\n8. Detailed documentation in DOCKER.md with examples for common operations made the Docker setup more accessible to the entire team.\n\n9. Using environment variables through .env files for secrets like API keys maintained security while keeping configuration flexible.\n\nThese approaches solved our cross-platform deployment challenges, particularly for the reinforcement learning components that had complex dependencies.",

Always use full, explicit image paths (e.g., debian:bookworm-slim) rather than relying on an earlier build stage name that might be ambiguous.\n2. The 'as' keyword in FROM statements should match the case of 'FROM' (using 'AS' instead of 'as' ensures consistency).\n3. When running Docker on Mac/Windows, you can access locally running services using 'host.docker.internal' as the hostname from inside containers.\n4. For services like Ollama that might be resource-intensive or require specific setup, consider using an already running local instance instead of duplicating it in Docker.\n5. Adding simple verification scripts like 'check_ollama.sh' can prevent cryptic errors by ensuring dependencies are available before starting services.",

              "description": "When encountering \"Permission denied (13)\" errors during rsync deployments with --delete flag, the issue is typically file ownership/permissions on the remote server preventing deletion of existing files.\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- rsync --delete tries to remove remote files that don't exist locally\n- If files are owned by root or another user, the deployment user can't delete them\n- Git directories (.git/) are particularly problematic due to complex file structures\n- Previous failed deployments can leave files with wrong ownership\n\n**Solution Pattern:**\n```bash\n# 1. Fix ownership before rsync\nssh remote_server \"\n    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /target/directory/\n    chmod -R u+w /target/directory/\n    \n    # Remove problematic directories entirely\n    if [ -d '/target/directory/problematic_dir' ]; then\n        sudo rm -rf /target/directory/problematic_dir/\n    fi\n    \n    # Clean up lock files\n    find /target/directory -name '*.lock' -type f -exec rm -f {} + 2>/dev/null || true\n\"\n\n# 2. Then run rsync\nrsync -avz --delete --progress -e \"ssh\" local/ user@remote:/target/directory/\n```\n\n**Prevention Strategies:**\n- Always set proper ownership during deployment setup\n- Use deployment-specific users (ubuntu, deploy) rather than root\n- Create deployment directories with correct permissions from start\n- Consider excluding .git directories from deployment entirely\n- Add permission fixes to deployment scripts proactively\n\n**SSH Alias Support:**\n```bash\n# Detect SSH alias availability and fall back gracefully\nSSH_CMD=\"ssh eaws\"  # Prefer aliases for convenience\nif ! ssh -o ConnectTimeout=2 eaws \"echo test\" >/dev/null 2>&1; then\n    SSH_CMD=\"ssh -i $KEY_PATH $USER@$IP\"  # Fallback to full command\nfi\n```\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- Fix permissions BEFORE rsync, not after errors occur\n- Remove problematic directories entirely rather than trying to fix complex permission trees\n- Test with small changes first before full deployments\n- Document your SSH setup (aliases, key paths) for team consistency\n- Always include error handling and fallbacks for automation scripts\n\nThis approach eliminates deployment friction and makes subsequent deployments fast and reliable.",

The Windows API (winapi crate) requires careful handling of strings with CString conversions and proper error handling.\n\n3. Asynchronous execution with tokio::task::spawn_blocking is crucial for UI responsiveness when performing potentially blocking operations like window manipulation.\n\n4. Using the builder pattern (with_window_identifier, with_operation, etc.) provides a clean API for action configuration in code.\n\n5. For operations that don't need to wait for completion, we can spawn a task and return immediately, providing better responsiveness.\n\n6. The Action trait implementation must properly handle platform-specific limitations, providing clear feedback when operations aren't supported.\n\n7. The DummyPlugin pattern is useful for spawned tasks that need a plugin reference but don't actually use plugin functionality.\n\n8.

Remember to handle screen coordinates properly for absolute positioning by normalizing to the 0-65535 range using GetSystemMetrics to get screen dimensions.",

              "description": "When encountering \"Permission denied (13)\" errors during rsync deployments with --delete flag, the issue is typically file ownership/permissions on the remote server preventing deletion of existing files.\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- rsync --delete tries to remove remote files that don't exist locally\n- If files are owned by root or another user, the deployment user can't delete them\n- Git directories (.git/) are particularly problematic due to complex file structures\n- Previous failed deployments can leave files with wrong ownership\n\n**Solution Pattern:**\n```bash\n# 1. Fix ownership before rsync\nssh remote_server \"\n    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /target/directory/\n    chmod -R u+w /target/directory/\n    \n    # Remove problematic directories entirely\n    if [ -d '/target/directory/problematic_dir' ]; then\n        sudo rm -rf /target/directory/problematic_dir/\n    fi\n    \n    # Clean up lock files\n    find /target/directory -name '*.lock' -type f -exec rm -f {} + 2>/dev/null || true\n\"\n\n# 2. Then run rsync\nrsync -avz --delete --progress -e \"ssh\" local/ user@remote:/target/directory/\n```\n\n**Prevention Strategies:**\n- Always set proper ownership during deployment setup\n- Use deployment-specific users (ubuntu, deploy) rather than root\n- Create deployment directories with correct permissions from start\n- Consider excluding .git directories from deployment entirely\n- Add permission fixes to deployment scripts proactively\n\n**SSH Alias Support:**\n```bash\n# Detect SSH alias availability and fall back gracefully\nSSH_CMD=\"ssh eaws\"  # Prefer aliases for convenience\nif ! ssh -o ConnectTimeout=2 eaws \"echo test\" >/dev/null 2>&1; then\n    SSH_CMD=\"ssh -i $KEY_PATH $USER@$IP\"  # Fallback to full command\nfi\n```\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- Fix permissions BEFORE rsync, not after errors occur\n- Remove problematic directories entirely rather than trying to fix complex permission trees\n- Test with small changes first before full deployments\n- Document your SSH setup (aliases, key paths) for team consistency\n- Always include error handling and fallbacks for automation scripts\n\nThis approach eliminates deployment friction and makes subsequent deployments fast and reliable.",

              "description": "When integrating HTTP clients in Lua/Hammerspoon environments, several key considerations are critical for success:\n\n1. **Error Handling is Paramount**: HTTP operations can fail for many reasons (network issues, server unavailable, timeouts). Always implement comprehensive error handling with pcall() and provide meaningful fallback behavior.\n\n2. **Caching is Essential**: For performance in real-time applications like Hammerspoon, implement intelligent caching mechanisms. A 5-minute cache significantly reduces server load while maintaining data freshness.\n\n3. **Fallback Systems Ensure Reliability**: Never depend solely on external services. Always maintain a fallback mechanism (like hardcoded project lists) to ensure the system remains functional even when the external service is unavailable.\n\n4. **Configuration Flexibility**: Use secrets/configuration files to make server URLs, timeouts, and other parameters configurable. This enables easy deployment across different environments.\n\n5. **Module Loading Safety**: When requiring external modules that may not exist, always use pcall() to prevent runtime errors and provide graceful degradation.\n\n6. **Testing Integration Points**: Create comprehensive integration tests that verify not just the happy path, but also error conditions and fallback behavior.\n\n7. **Transparent Operation**: Design integrations to be transparent to end users - existing functionality should work unchanged, with improvements happening behind the scenes.\n\n8. **Global State Management**: In Hammerspoon, use _G for global state management, but be careful about singleton patterns to avoid multiple initialization issues.\n\n9. **Documentation and Logging**: Provide detailed logging for debugging and comprehensive documentation for future maintenance.\n\n10. **HTTP Client Considerations**: Use hs.http for HTTP operations in Hammerspoon, and always handle response parsing (JSON) with proper error checking.",

Always implement comprehensive error handling with pcall() and provide meaningful fallback behavior.\n\n2. **Caching is Essential**: For performance in real-time applications like Hammerspoon, implement intelligent caching mechanisms. A 5-minute cache significantly reduces server load while maintaining data freshness.\n\n3. **Fallback Systems Ensure Reliability**: Never depend solely on external services. Always maintain a fallback mechanism (like hardcoded project lists) to ensure the system remains functional even when the external service is unavailable.\n\n4. **Configuration Flexibility**: Use secrets/configuration files to make server URLs, timeouts, and other parameters configurable. This enables easy deployment across different environments.\n\n5. **Module Loading Safety**: When requiring external modules that may not exist, always use pcall() to prevent runtime errors and provide graceful degradation.\n\n6. **Testing Integration Points**: Create comprehensive integration tests that verify not just the happy path, but also error conditions and fallback behavior.\n\n7. **Transparent Operation**: Design integrations to be transparent to end users - existing functionality should work unchanged, with improvements happening behind the scenes.\n\n8. **Global State Management**: In Hammerspoon, use _G for global state management, but be careful about singleton patterns to avoid multiple initialization issues.\n\n9. **Documentation and Logging**: Provide detailed logging for debugging and comprehensive documentation for future maintenance.\n\n10. **HTTP Client Considerations**: Use hs.http for HTTP operations in Hammerspoon, and always handle response parsing (JSON) with proper error checking.",

The oneditprepare function handles UI initialization and event handlers.\n\n2. **Node Implementation Structure**: Always use RED.nodes.createNode(this, config) for initialization, implement proper message handling with send/done callbacks, and include comprehensive status updates for user feedback.\n\n3. **Publishing Workflow**: Update version in package.json, maintain CHANGELOG.md, create git tags, npm publish, then manual submission to Node-RED Flow Library (automatic sync ended in 2020).\n\n4. **Template Processing**: Distinguish between template content (HTML with placeholders) and template data (JSON for substitution). Support multiple data sources: msg properties, flow context, global context.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Implement graceful fallbacks, detailed error logging, and visual status indicators. Always provide fallback options when primary functionality fails.\n\n6. **Performance**: Use file watching with modification time caching, efficient string processing, and proper cleanup on node removal.\n\n7. **User Experience**: Progressive disclosure (hide advanced options by default), form validation, comprehensive help documentation with examples.\n\nThese patterns proved successful for a production Node-RED node and should be applied to future projects like the planned mad-template-ai node.",

Key learnings: 1) Progressive disclosure prevents overwhelming users with too many options at once, 2) Visual icons and consistent formatting enhance usability and memorability, 3) Search integration provides quick access while maintaining discoverability, 4) Real-time configuration updates enhance user confidence, 5) Submenu navigation with back buttons creates familiar interaction patterns, 6) Status displays help users understand system state, 7) Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental destructive actions. The DragonGrid-inspired design pattern works well for technical tools where users need access to many functions but don't want to memorize complex hotkey combinations. Singleton pattern with global state management ensures consistent behavior across the application.",

Form values weren't being correctly captured and saved\n2. Case sensitivity in field comparisons caused changes to be ignored\n3. The Angular data binding wasn't properly syncing between UI and scope\n\nSolutions implemented:\n1. Added explicit field change handlers (ng-change directives) to capture input changes\n2. Modified comparison logic to be case-insensitive \n3. Added helper function to explicitly update scope variables on field changes\n4. Added force scope update before saving to ensure DOM changes are synced\n5. Simplified the update approach to send all defined fields\n\nKey takeaways:\n- Always add field change handlers for critical form fields\n- Use explicit scope updates when dealing with complex forms\n- Add extensive logging to help troubleshoot binding issues\n- Consider field normalization on both client and server side",

Key implementation patterns:\n\n1. **Environment Flag Pattern**: Used CRON_COMMIT_AI flag to toggle AI functionality\n2. **Graceful Fallback**: Always check for ollama availability and provide standard fallback\n3. **AI Response Validation**: Validate AI output length and content before using\n4. **Proper Error Handling**: Use stderr for warnings, return codes for control flow\n5. **Shell Function Design**: Created reusable generate_ai_commit_message() function\n6. **Prompt Engineering**: Crafted specific prompt for conventional commit format\n7. **Integration Testing**: Test both AI and standard modes to ensure compatibility\n\nThe result is a robust script that enhances git workflows with AI while maintaining reliability through fallback mechanisms. AI-generated commits showed better conventional format adherence (e.g., \"docs: update test_ai_commit.txt\") compared to standard format.",

              "description": "When using Docker multi-stage builds, pay close attention to the FROM statements. In our case, a reference to a non-existent 'runtime' image was causing build failures. \n\nKey learnings:\n1. Always use full, explicit image paths (e.g., debian:bookworm-slim) rather than relying on an earlier build stage name that might be ambiguous.\n2. The 'as' keyword in FROM statements should match the case of 'FROM' (using 'AS' instead of 'as' ensures consistency).\n3. When running Docker on Mac/Windows, you can access locally running services using 'host.docker.internal' as the hostname from inside containers.\n4. For services like Ollama that might be resource-intensive or require specific setup, consider using an already running local instance instead of duplicating it in Docker.\n5. Adding simple verification scripts like 'check_ollama.sh' can prevent cryptic errors by ensuring dependencies are available before starting services.",

              "description": "When scaling monitoring systems to handle thousands of gateways, we encountered several key lessons:\n\n1. **File-based storage becomes a bottleneck**: Writing and reading JSON files for each monitoring cycle created significant I/O overhead as the number of gateways increased. Redis provided a much more efficient alternative with O(1) lookups.\n\n2. **Data serialization matters**: When storing data in Redis, all values must be properly serialized. We found that stringifying all values (even nulls and integers) prevented unexpected errors during Redis operations.\n\n3. **Pipelines improve performance**: Using Redis pipelines to batch operations significantly reduced network round-trips and improved performance by 10x for large datasets.\n\n4. **Fallback mechanisms are crucial**: Always implement a fallback to the previous storage mechanism when introducing a new one. We designed the system to gracefully fall back to file-based storage if Redis was unavailable.\n\n5. **Structured key namespaces**: Using a consistent naming convention with prefixes (`gateway:`, `elements:`, `meta:`) made the Redis database more manageable and enabled easier targeted operations.\n\n6. **TTL settings prevent unbounded growth**: Setting appropriate expiration policies prevented the Redis database from growing indefinitely as new monitoring data accumulated.\n\n7. **Filtering irrelevant data early**: By filtering for only 32-character UUIDs at the data collection stage, we avoided wasting resources processing and storing irrelevant gateways.\n\nThese lessons helped us build a monitoring system that could scale to thousands of gateways while maintaining responsive performance.",

Hybrid Storage Strategy:**\n- **Config Users**: Static users in `auth_config.json` (demo, admin)\n- **Registered Users**: Dynamic users in `localStorage` as JSON\n- **Unified Access**: `getAllUsers()` merges both sources seamlessly\n\n### **2. Authentication Flow:**\n```javascript\n// Registration Flow\nregister(userData) \u2192 validate \u2192 save to localStorage \u2192 success\n// Login Flow  \nlogin(credentials) \u2192 check allUsers \u2192 authenticate \u2192 set session\n```\n\n### **3. UI/UX Enhancements:**\n- **Tabbed Interface**: Clean separation of Login/Register\n- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on form errors\n- **Password Visibility**: Toggle buttons for better UX\n- **Account Types**: User/Demo/Admin selection with clear descriptions\n- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive client-side validation\n\n### **4.

The code assumed it would always be a string and called `.strip()` without type checking.\n\n**Solution:** Added proper type checking with `isinstance(enhanced_description, str)` before attempting string operations:\n\n```python\n# Before (causes AttributeError):\nif enhanced_description and enhanced_description.strip():\n\n# After (safe type checking):\nif enhanced_description and isinstance(enhanced_description, str) and enhanced_description.strip():\n```\n\n**Key Lessons:**\n1. Always validate data types when working with database fields that may have inconsistent schemas\n2. Use `isinstance()` checks before calling type-specific methods\n3. Database field type inconsistency can cause runtime errors in production\n4. MCP tools need robust error handling for data integrity issues\n5.

              "description": "When designing toggle functions for window management, implementing intelligent state management greatly improves user experience. The WindowToggler enhancement demonstrates a smart cycling pattern:\n\n1. **Automatic Location Creation**: Instead of requiring manual setup, the toggle function creates saved positions automatically based on usage\n2. **Intelligent Fallbacks**: The function handles edge cases (no locations, only one location, etc.) gracefully  \n3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear alerts inform users which action was taken and which location is active\n4. **Position Tolerance**: Using fuzzy matching (\u00b110 pixels) prevents minor position differences from breaking the cycle\n\nKey implementation pattern:\n```lua\n-- Check what locations exist\nlocal hasLocation1 = WindowToggler.location1[windowId] ~= nil\nlocal hasLocation2 = WindowToggler.location2[windowId] ~= nil\n\n-- Use position matching to determine current state\nif positionMatches(WindowToggler.location1[windowId]) then\n    -- At location 1, move to location 2\nelseif positionMatches(WindowToggler.location2[windowId]) then  \n    -- At location 2, move to location 1\nelse\n    -- Unknown position, establish baseline\nend\n```\n\nThis pattern creates a seamless user experience where a single hotkey builds and manages a two-position workflow automatically, rather than requiring explicit setup steps.",

Key learnings:\n\n### **State Management Strategy**\n- Use separate state for edit mode, quick edit field, and form data\n- Track unsaved changes with useEffect comparing current vs original data\n- Provide clear exit patterns with confirmation dialogs\n\n### **Animation Approach**\n- Material-UI Collapse, Fade, Slide components create smooth transitions\n- Stagger animations with different timeouts for polish\n- Transform and elevation changes on edit mode for visual feedback\n\n### **User Experience Patterns**\n- **Quick Edit**: Click any field to edit just that field inline\n- **Full Edit**: Edit button expands all fields with form layout\n- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: ESC to cancel, Ctrl+Enter to save\n- **Visual Feedback**: Border color changes, elevation, loading states\n\n### **Form Validation & Error Handling**\n```jsx\nconst [hasUnsavedChanges, setHasUnsavedChanges] = useState(false);\nconst [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\n// Track changes\nuseEffect(() => {\n    const hasChanges = Object.keys(formData).some(key => \n        formData[key] !== (todo[key] || '')\n    );\n    setHasUnsavedChanges(hasChanges);\n}, [formData, todo]);\n```\n\n### **API Integration**\n- Filter unchanged fields before sending updates\n- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages  \n- Optimistic updates with rollback on error\n\n### **Accessibility**\n- Proper ARIA labels for edit states\n- Keyboard navigation support\n- Screen reader friendly state announcements\n\nThis pattern provides excellent UX - no context switching, immediate feedback, and smooth animations. Much better than separate edit pages!",

              "description": "\ud83d\ude80 **MASTERCLASS: Translating Complex Node-RED UI to Modern React**\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf **PROJECT CONTEXT**\nSuccessfully translated a feature-rich Node-RED TodoList.html (877 lines) to React with complete feature parity and enhancements. This was a complex multi-phase project requiring deep understanding of both Node-RED UI patterns and modern React best practices.\n\n## \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f **ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH**\n\n### **1. Component Decomposition Strategy**\n```jsx\n// Instead of one monolithic component, create a layered architecture:\nAdvancedTodoList.jsx       // Main UI component (600+ lines)\nuseAdvancedTodos.js        // State management hook\ntodoAPI.js                 // Enhanced API layer\nDashboard.js               // Integration layer\n```\n\n### **2. State Management Pattern**\n```jsx\n// Custom hook encapsulates all todo logic:\nconst useAdvancedTodos = () => {\n  // Optimistic updates for instant UI feedback\n  const completeTodo = useCallback(async (todoId) => {\n    // Update UI immediately\n    setTodos(prev => prev.filter(todo => todo.id !== todoId));\n    // Then sync with backend\n    await todoAPI.completeTodo(todoId);\n  }, []);\n  \n  // Real-time statistics calculation\n  const statistics = useMemo(() => {\n    // Calculate from current state, not API\n    return calculateStats(todos, completedTodos);\n  }, [todos, completedTodos]);\n};\n```\n\n### **3. Performance Optimization Techniques**\n```jsx\n// Memoization for expensive operations\nconst filteredAndSortedTodos = useMemo(() => {\n  // Complex filtering and sorting logic\n}, [todos, searchText, filterMode, sortMode, projectFilter]);\n\n// Callback memoization to prevent re-renders\nconst handleCompleteTodo = useCallback((todoId) => {\n  // Action logic\n}, [completeTodo]);\n\n// Component memoization for large lists\nconst TodoCard = React.memo(({ todo, onComplete, onUpdate }) => {\n  // Card rendering logic\n});\n```\n\n## \ud83c\udfa8 **UI/UX TRANSLATION LESSONS**\n\n### **1. Progressive Enhancement Approach**\nStart with basic functionality, then layer on advanced features:\n```jsx\n// Phase 1: Basic CRUD operations\n// Phase 2: Advanced filtering, search, statistics\n// Phase 3: AI integration, animations, responsive design\n```\n\n### **2. Visual Hierarchy Translation**\n```jsx\n// Node-RED: Fixed header + scrollable content\n// React: Flexible layout with proper spacing\n<Box sx={{ height: '100%', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>\n  <Paper sx={{ p: 3, mb: 2 }}>Header Section</Paper>\n  <Box sx={{ flexGrow: 1, overflow: 'auto' }}>Scrollable Content</Box>\n</Box>\n```\n\n### **3.

This was a complex multi-phase project requiring deep understanding of both Node-RED UI patterns and modern React best practices.\n\n## \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f **ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH**\n\n### **1. Component Decomposition Strategy**\n```jsx\n// Instead of one monolithic component, create a layered architecture:\nAdvancedTodoList.jsx       // Main UI component (600+ lines)\nuseAdvancedTodos.js        // State management hook\ntodoAPI.js                 // Enhanced API layer\nDashboard.js               // Integration layer\n```\n\n### **2. State Management Pattern**\n```jsx\n// Custom hook encapsulates all todo logic:\nconst useAdvancedTodos = () => {\n  // Optimistic updates for instant UI feedback\n  const completeTodo = useCallback(async (todoId) => {\n    // Update UI immediately\n    setTodos(prev => prev.filter(todo => todo.id !== todoId));\n    // Then sync with backend\n    await todoAPI.completeTodo(todoId);\n  }, []);\n  \n  // Real-time statistics calculation\n  const statistics = useMemo(() => {\n    // Calculate from current state, not API\n    return calculateStats(todos, completedTodos);\n  }, [todos, completedTodos]);\n};\n```\n\n### **3. Performance Optimization Techniques**\n```jsx\n// Memoization for expensive operations\nconst filteredAndSortedTodos = useMemo(() => {\n  // Complex filtering and sorting logic\n}, [todos, searchText, filterMode, sortMode, projectFilter]);\n\n// Callback memoization to prevent re-renders\nconst handleCompleteTodo = useCallback((todoId) => {\n  // Action logic\n}, [completeTodo]);\n\n// Component memoization for large lists\nconst TodoCard = React.memo(({ todo, onComplete, onUpdate }) => {\n  // Card rendering logic\n});\n```\n\n## \ud83c\udfa8 **UI/UX TRANSLATION LESSONS**\n\n### **1. Progressive Enhancement Approach**\nStart with basic functionality, then layer on advanced features:\n```jsx\n// Phase 1: Basic CRUD operations\n// Phase 2: Advanced filtering, search, statistics\n// Phase 3: AI integration, animations, responsive design\n```\n\n### **2. Visual Hierarchy Translation**\n```jsx\n// Node-RED: Fixed header + scrollable content\n// React: Flexible layout with proper spacing\n<Box sx={{ height: '100%', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>\n  <Paper sx={{ p: 3, mb: 2 }}>Header Section</Paper>\n  <Box sx={{ flexGrow: 1, overflow: 'auto' }}>Scrollable Content</Box>\n</Box>\n```\n\n### **3.

              "description": "**Issue:** The `get_todo_tool` was crashing with AttributeError when trying to call `.strip()` on `enhanced_description` fields that contained boolean values (`false`/`true`) instead of strings.\n\n**Root Cause:** Database inconsistency where some todos had `enhanced_description` set to boolean values rather than strings. The code assumed it would always be a string and called `.strip()` without type checking.\n\n**Solution:** Added proper type checking with `isinstance(enhanced_description, str)` before attempting string operations:\n\n```python\n# Before (causes AttributeError):\nif enhanced_description and enhanced_description.strip():\n\n# After (safe type checking):\nif enhanced_description and isinstance(enhanced_description, str) and enhanced_description.strip():\n```\n\n**Key Lessons:**\n1. Always validate data types when working with database fields that may have inconsistent schemas\n2. Use `isinstance()` checks before calling type-specific methods\n3. Database field type inconsistency can cause runtime errors in production\n4. MCP tools need robust error handling for data integrity issues\n5. Type safety is crucial for AI agent integration tools\n\n**Prevention:** Implement database schema validation and consistent field typing across all todo creation/update operations.",

Service-specific PM2 restart (`madness-backend` only)\n2. Better timing/sequencing\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\nALWAYS clarify the exact problem before implementing solutions. Ask clarifying questions when the problem statement could be interpreted multiple ways. Simple problems often have simple solutions - resist the urge to over-engineer.\n\n**Red Flags to Watch For:**\n- User follows up with \"should have said\" or clarification\n- Adding complex logic when simple fix might work\n- Not confirming understanding of the actual problem",

              "description": "When encountering \"Permission denied (13)\" errors during rsync deployments with --delete flag, the issue is typically file ownership/permissions on the remote server preventing deletion of existing files.\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- rsync --delete tries to remove remote files that don't exist locally\n- If files are owned by root or another user, the deployment user can't delete them\n- Git directories (.git/) are particularly problematic due to complex file structures\n- Previous failed deployments can leave files with wrong ownership\n\n**Solution Pattern:**\n```bash\n# 1. Fix ownership before rsync\nssh remote_server \"\n    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /target/directory/\n    chmod -R u+w /target/directory/\n    \n    # Remove problematic directories entirely\n    if [ -d '/target/directory/problematic_dir' ]; then\n        sudo rm -rf /target/directory/problematic_dir/\n    fi\n    \n    # Clean up lock files\n    find /target/directory -name '*.lock' -type f -exec rm -f {} + 2>/dev/null || true\n\"\n\n# 2. Then run rsync\nrsync -avz --delete --progress -e \"ssh\" local/ user@remote:/target/directory/\n```\n\n**Prevention Strategies:**\n- Always set proper ownership during deployment setup\n- Use deployment-specific users (ubuntu, deploy) rather than root\n- Create deployment directories with correct permissions from start\n- Consider excluding .git directories from deployment entirely\n- Add permission fixes to deployment scripts proactively\n\n**SSH Alias Support:**\n```bash\n# Detect SSH alias availability and fall back gracefully\nSSH_CMD=\"ssh eaws\"  # Prefer aliases for convenience\nif ! ssh -o ConnectTimeout=2 eaws \"echo test\" >/dev/null 2>&1; then\n    SSH_CMD=\"ssh -i $KEY_PATH $USER@$IP\"  # Fallback to full command\nfi\n```\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- Fix permissions BEFORE rsync, not after errors occur\n- Remove problematic directories entirely rather than trying to fix complex permission trees\n- Test with small changes first before full deployments\n- Document your SSH setup (aliases, key paths) for team consistency\n- Always include error handling and fallbacks for automation scripts\n\nThis approach eliminates deployment friction and makes subsequent deployments fast and reliable.",

Key learnings:\n\n### **State Management Strategy**\n- Use separate state for edit mode, quick edit field, and form data\n- Track unsaved changes with useEffect comparing current vs original data\n- Provide clear exit patterns with confirmation dialogs\n\n### **Animation Approach**\n- Material-UI Collapse, Fade, Slide components create smooth transitions\n- Stagger animations with different timeouts for polish\n- Transform and elevation changes on edit mode for visual feedback\n\n### **User Experience Patterns**\n- **Quick Edit**: Click any field to edit just that field inline\n- **Full Edit**: Edit button expands all fields with form layout\n- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: ESC to cancel, Ctrl+Enter to save\n- **Visual Feedback**: Border color changes, elevation, loading states\n\n### **Form Validation & Error Handling**\n```jsx\nconst [hasUnsavedChanges, setHasUnsavedChanges] = useState(false);\nconst [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\n// Track changes\nuseEffect(() => {\n    const hasChanges = Object.keys(formData).some(key => \n        formData[key] !== (todo[key] || '')\n    );\n    setHasUnsavedChanges(hasChanges);\n}, [formData, todo]);\n```\n\n### **API Integration**\n- Filter unchanged fields before sending updates\n- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages  \n- Optimistic updates with rollback on error\n\n### **Accessibility**\n- Proper ARIA labels for edit states\n- Keyboard navigation support\n- Screen reader friendly state announcements\n\nThis pattern provides excellent UX - no context switching, immediate feedback, and smooth animations. Much better than separate edit pages!",

              "description": "To interact with tools on the Omnispindle FastMCP server via a custom client, a specific Server-Sent Events (SSE) workflow must be followed. Direct calls to a static tool endpoint like `/tools/<tool_name>` will fail.\n\nThe correct procedure is:\n\n1.  **Establish Connection**: Initiate an HTTP GET request to the main `/sse` endpoint. This opens a persistent SSE stream.\n\n2.  **Receive Session Endpoint**: The server's first message on the stream will be an `endpoint` event. The data of this event contains a unique path for your session, for example: `data: /messages?session_id=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`.\n\n3.  **Call a Tool**: To execute a tool, send an HTTP POST request to the unique session URL provided by the server (e.g., `http://<server_ip>:<port>/messages?session_id=...`).\n\n4.  **Format the Payload**: The body of the POST request must be a JSON object containing the tool's name and its arguments at the top level. For example: `{\"tool_name\": \"add_todo\", \"description\": \"My new task\"}`.\n\n5.  **Receive Results**: The results of the tool call will be streamed back over the original SSE connection established in step 1.",

              "description": "When working with global configuration in Hammerspoon that affects multiple modules, it's critical to establish the global state BEFORE loading dependent modules. In this case, we had FileManager loading via hotkeys.lua before init.lua set up _G.MCPClientType, causing FileManager to default to HTTP mode while init.lua later loaded SSE mode - resulting in both clients running simultaneously. The fix was to move the secrets loading and global configuration setup to happen before require('loadConfig') and dofile(hotkeys.lua), ensuring all dependent modules see the correct configuration when they initialize. This prevents race conditions and conflicting client instances.",

Key learnings:\n\n1. **Authentication Middleware Design**: Created a single middleware function that handles both Bearer tokens (Auth0) and Basic authentication (demo mode), setting req.user with appropriate permissions.\n\n2. **Data Filtering Strategy**: \n   - Auth0 users: Filter by user_id field in MongoDB queries\n   - Demo users: Filter by predefined project list for curated experience\n   - Each user type gets completely isolated data views\n\n3. **User ID Generation**: For Auth0 tokens, generate consistent user IDs using token prefix (auth0|token-prefix) to ensure data persistence across sessions.\n\n4. **API Documentation**: Used Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0 with swagger-ui-express to create comprehensive API documentation accessible at /docs endpoint.\n\n5. **Testing Strategy**: Verified isolation by creating todos with different bearer tokens and confirming users only see their own data.\n\n6. **Demo Mode Benefits**: Allows public access with read-only permissions while showing realistic data subset, perfect for showcasing the application.\n\nThis pattern works excellently for multi-tenant SaaS applications where user data must be completely isolated while still supporting demo/trial access.",

The code assumed it would always be a string and called `.strip()` without type checking.\n\n**Solution:** Added proper type checking with `isinstance(enhanced_description, str)` before attempting string operations:\n\n```python\n# Before (causes AttributeError):\nif enhanced_description and enhanced_description.strip():\n\n# After (safe type checking):\nif enhanced_description and isinstance(enhanced_description, str) and enhanced_description.strip():\n```\n\n**Key Lessons:**\n1. Always validate data types when working with database fields that may have inconsistent schemas\n2. Use `isinstance()` checks before calling type-specific methods\n3. Database field type inconsistency can cause runtime errors in production\n4. MCP tools need robust error handling for data integrity issues\n5.

Data Normalization (from update-multiple-fields.js)**\n```javascript\n// Handle specific field types correctly\nswitch (field) {\n    case 'description':\n    case 'enhanced_description': \n    case 'notes':\n        // Allow empty strings as valid values\n        normalizedValue = trimmed;\n        break;\n    case 'ticket':\n    case 'project':\n        // Convert empty strings to null\n        normalizedValue = trimmed === '' ? null : trimmed;\n        break;\n    case 'priority':\n        // Validate against allowed values\n        const validPriorities = ['initial', 'low', 'medium', 'high'];\n        normalizedValue = validPriorities.includes(trimmed.toLowerCase()) \n            ? trimmed.toLowerCase() : 'medium';\n        break;\n}\n```\n\n#### **2. Operation Logging (from LogTodoOperation.js)**\n```javascript\nconst logEntry = {\n    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\n    todoId: id,\n    operation: 'update_multiple',\n    project: normalizedUpdates.project || 'inventorium',\n    changes: changes,\n    userAgent: 'React Dashboard'\n};\n\n// Log to backend endpoint\nawait apiClient.post('/api/todos/log', logEntry);\n```\n\n#### **3. Enhanced Error Handling**\n- **403**: \"Access denied - check authentication credentials\"\n- **404**: \"Todo not found - may have been deleted\"  \n- **400**: \"Invalid data: [specific message]\"\n- **Fallback**: Original error message or generic failure\n\n#### **4. Improved Console Logging**\n- Emoji prefixes for easy identification (\ud83d\udd27 \ud83d\udcbe \u2705 \u274c)\n- Detailed operation tracking\n- Before/after data comparisons\n\n### **Technical Insights**\n- **Empty String Handling**: Critical to distinguish between \"clear field\" vs \"no change\"\n- **Validation at API Layer**: Prevent invalid data from reaching backend\n- **Non-blocking Logging**: Don't fail operations if logging fails\n- **Detailed Error Messages**: Help users understand and fix issues\n\n### **Benefits Achieved**\n- \u2705 Fixed saving functionality with proper data validation\n- \u2705 Added comprehensive operation logging for debugging\n- \u2705 Better error messages for user troubleshooting\n- \u2705 Maintained compatibility with existing backend systems\n\nThis approach ensures robust data handling and excellent debugging capabilities, matching the proven patterns from the Node-RED TodoMill system.",

              "description": "## Fixing 403 Save Errors & Implementing TodoMill-Style Logging\n\nSuccessfully diagnosed and fixed saving issues in the React todo editing system by implementing proper data normalization and logging similar to the Node-RED TodoMill system.\n\n### **Problem Diagnosis**\n- **403 Forbidden Error**: User couldn't save changes to todos\n- **Root Cause**: Improper data normalization and missing validation\n- **Solution**: Implement Node-RED style data processing and logging\n\n### **Key Fixes Implemented**\n\n#### **1. Data Normalization (from update-multiple-fields.js)**\n```javascript\n// Handle specific field types correctly\nswitch (field) {\n    case 'description':\n    case 'enhanced_description': \n    case 'notes':\n        // Allow empty strings as valid values\n        normalizedValue = trimmed;\n        break;\n    case 'ticket':\n    case 'project':\n        // Convert empty strings to null\n        normalizedValue = trimmed === '' ? null : trimmed;\n        break;\n    case 'priority':\n        // Validate against allowed values\n        const validPriorities = ['initial', 'low', 'medium', 'high'];\n        normalizedValue = validPriorities.includes(trimmed.toLowerCase()) \n            ? trimmed.toLowerCase() : 'medium';\n        break;\n}\n```\n\n#### **2. Operation Logging (from LogTodoOperation.js)**\n```javascript\nconst logEntry = {\n    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\n    todoId: id,\n    operation: 'update_multiple',\n    project: normalizedUpdates.project || 'inventorium',\n    changes: changes,\n    userAgent: 'React Dashboard'\n};\n\n// Log to backend endpoint\nawait apiClient.post('/api/todos/log', logEntry);\n```\n\n#### **3. Enhanced Error Handling**\n- **403**: \"Access denied - check authentication credentials\"\n- **404**: \"Todo not found - may have been deleted\"  \n- **400**: \"Invalid data: [specific message]\"\n- **Fallback**: Original error message or generic failure\n\n#### **4. Improved Console Logging**\n- Emoji prefixes for easy identification (\ud83d\udd27 \ud83d\udcbe \u2705 \u274c)\n- Detailed operation tracking\n- Before/after data comparisons\n\n### **Technical Insights**\n- **Empty String Handling**: Critical to distinguish between \"clear field\" vs \"no change\"\n- **Validation at API Layer**: Prevent invalid data from reaching backend\n- **Non-blocking Logging**: Don't fail operations if logging fails\n- **Detailed Error Messages**: Help users understand and fix issues\n\n### **Benefits Achieved**\n- \u2705 Fixed saving functionality with proper data validation\n- \u2705 Added comprehensive operation logging for debugging\n- \u2705 Better error messages for user troubleshooting\n- \u2705 Maintained compatibility with existing backend systems\n\nThis approach ensures robust data handling and excellent debugging capabilities, matching the proven patterns from the Node-RED TodoMill system.",

This was a complex multi-phase project requiring deep understanding of both Node-RED UI patterns and modern React best practices.\n\n## \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f **ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH**\n\n### **1. Component Decomposition Strategy**\n```jsx\n// Instead of one monolithic component, create a layered architecture:\nAdvancedTodoList.jsx       // Main UI component (600+ lines)\nuseAdvancedTodos.js        // State management hook\ntodoAPI.js                 // Enhanced API layer\nDashboard.js               // Integration layer\n```\n\n### **2. State Management Pattern**\n```jsx\n// Custom hook encapsulates all todo logic:\nconst useAdvancedTodos = () => {\n  // Optimistic updates for instant UI feedback\n  const completeTodo = useCallback(async (todoId) => {\n    // Update UI immediately\n    setTodos(prev => prev.filter(todo => todo.id !== todoId));\n    // Then sync with backend\n    await todoAPI.completeTodo(todoId);\n  }, []);\n  \n  // Real-time statistics calculation\n  const statistics = useMemo(() => {\n    // Calculate from current state, not API\n    return calculateStats(todos, completedTodos);\n  }, [todos, completedTodos]);\n};\n```\n\n### **3. Performance Optimization Techniques**\n```jsx\n// Memoization for expensive operations\nconst filteredAndSortedTodos = useMemo(() => {\n  // Complex filtering and sorting logic\n}, [todos, searchText, filterMode, sortMode, projectFilter]);\n\n// Callback memoization to prevent re-renders\nconst handleCompleteTodo = useCallback((todoId) => {\n  // Action logic\n}, [completeTodo]);\n\n// Component memoization for large lists\nconst TodoCard = React.memo(({ todo, onComplete, onUpdate }) => {\n  // Card rendering logic\n});\n```\n\n## \ud83c\udfa8 **UI/UX TRANSLATION LESSONS**\n\n### **1. Progressive Enhancement Approach**\nStart with basic functionality, then layer on advanced features:\n```jsx\n// Phase 1: Basic CRUD operations\n// Phase 2: Advanced filtering, search, statistics\n// Phase 3: AI integration, animations, responsive design\n```\n\n### **2. Visual Hierarchy Translation**\n```jsx\n// Node-RED: Fixed header + scrollable content\n// React: Flexible layout with proper spacing\n<Box sx={{ height: '100%', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>\n  <Paper sx={{ p: 3, mb: 2 }}>Header Section</Paper>\n  <Box sx={{ flexGrow: 1, overflow: 'auto' }}>Scrollable Content</Box>\n</Box>\n```\n\n### **3. Interactive State Management**\n```jsx\n// Expandable cards with smooth animations\nconst [expandedTodos, setExpandedTodos] = useState(new Set());\n\n<Collapse in={expandedTodos.has(todo.id)}>\n  <Box sx={{ p: 2 }}>\n    <ButtonGroup variant=\"outlined\">\n      {/* Action buttons */}\n    </ButtonGroup>\n  </Box>\n</Collapse>\n```\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 **ADVANCED FEATURES IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n### **1. Smart Search & Filtering**\n```jsx\n// Multi-field search with debouncing\nconst filteredTodos = useMemo(() => {\n  if (!searchText.trim()) return todos;\n  \n  const searchLower = searchText.toLowerCase();\n  return todos.filter(todo =>\n    todo.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||\n    todo.project?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||\n    todo.id.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower)\n  );\n}, [todos, searchText]);\n\n// Cycling filter modes (inspired by Node-RED button behavior)\nconst cycleFilterMode = useCallback(() => {\n  const modes = ['all', 'pending', 'review', 'completed'];\n  const currentIndex = modes.indexOf(filterMode);\n  const nextIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % modes.length;\n  setFilterMode(modes[nextIndex]);\n}, [filterMode]);\n```\n\n### **2. Real-time Statistics Dashboard**\n```jsx\n// Live calculation from current state (not API calls)\nconst statistics = useMemo(() => {\n  const stats = {\n    total: todos.length,\n    pending: 0,\n    review: 0,\n    high_priority: 0,\n    // ... calculate from todos array\n  };\n  \n  todos.forEach(todo => {\n    switch (todo.status) {\n      case 'pending': stats.pending++; break;\n      case 'review': stats.review++; break;\n    }\n    // Priority counting logic\n  });\n  \n  return stats;\n}, [todos, completedTodos]);\n```\n\n### **3.

Material-UI Integration**\n```jsx\n// Consistent theming with custom colors\n<Card sx={{\n  borderLeft: `4px solid ${getPriorityColor(todo.priority)}`,\n  transition: 'all 0.3s ease',\n  '&:hover': {\n    transform: 'translateY(-1px)',\n    boxShadow: '0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)',\n  },\n}}>\n```\n\n### **2. Priority-based Visual System**\n```jsx\nconst getPriorityColor = useCallback((priority) => {\n  switch (priority?.toLowerCase()) {\n    case 'high': return '#e53935';\n    case 'medium': return '#fb8c00';\n    case 'low': return '#43a047';\n    default: return '#757575';\n  }\n}, []);\n```\n\n### **3. Responsive Design Patterns**\n```jsx\n// Mobile-first approach with breakpoints\n<Grid container spacing={2}>\n  <Grid item xs={6} sm={4} md={2}>\n    <Card>Statistics</Card>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 **API INTEGRATION BEST PRACTICES**\n\n### **1. Axios Client Configuration**\n```jsx\n// Centralized API client with interceptors\nconst apiClient = axios.create({\n  baseURL: API_BASE_URL,\n  timeout: 10000,\n});\n\n// Auto-retry on auth failures\napiClient.interceptors.response.use(\n  (response) => response,\n  (error) => {\n    if (error.response?.status === 401) {\n      // Handle auth expiration\n    }\n    return Promise.reject(error);\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### **2. Optimistic UI Updates**\n```jsx\n// Update UI first, sync with backend second\nconst updateTodo = useCallback(async (todoId, updates) => {\n  // Immediate UI update\n  setTodos(prev => prev.map(todo => \n    todo.id === todoId ? { ...todo, ...updates } : todo\n  ));\n  \n  try {\n    // Backend sync\n    await todoAPI.updateTodo(todoId, updates);\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Revert UI changes on failure\n    await fetchTodos(); // Refresh from backend\n    throw error;\n  }\n}, []);\n```\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **KEY LEARNINGS**\n\n### **1. Migration Strategy**\n- **Phase-based approach**: Don't try to translate everything at once\n- **Feature parity first**: Match existing functionality before adding enhancements\n- **Backward compatibility**: Ensure new components work with existing infrastructure\n\n### **2. Performance Considerations**\n- **Memoization is critical**: Large todo lists can cause performance issues\n- **Optimize re-renders**: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback strategically\n- **Debounce expensive operations**: Search and filtering should be debounced\n\n### **3. User Experience Focus**\n- **Immediate feedback**: Users expect instant responses to actions\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Use expandable sections to manage complexity\n- **Error recovery**: Always provide clear error messages and recovery options\n\n### **4. Code Organization**\n- **Separation of concerns**: Keep components, hooks, and API layers separate\n- **Reusable patterns**: Create custom hooks for complex state management\n- **Type safety**: Use PropTypes or TypeScript for better development experience\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f **SUCCESS METRICS**\n- **100% feature parity**: All Node-RED features successfully translated\n- **Enhanced UX**: Modern React patterns improve user experience\n- **Performance gains**: Optimistic updates and memoization provide instant feedback\n- **Maintainability**: Modular architecture easier to extend and debug\n- **Mobile support**: Responsive design works across all devices\n\nThis translation project demonstrates how to modernize legacy UI while preserving functionality and improving user experience.

Component Decomposition Strategy**\n```jsx\n// Instead of one monolithic component, create a layered architecture:\nAdvancedTodoList.jsx       // Main UI component (600+ lines)\nuseAdvancedTodos.js        // State management hook\ntodoAPI.js                 // Enhanced API layer\nDashboard.js               // Integration layer\n```\n\n### **2. State Management Pattern**\n```jsx\n// Custom hook encapsulates all todo logic:\nconst useAdvancedTodos = () => {\n  // Optimistic updates for instant UI feedback\n  const completeTodo = useCallback(async (todoId) => {\n    // Update UI immediately\n    setTodos(prev => prev.filter(todo => todo.id !== todoId));\n    // Then sync with backend\n    await todoAPI.completeTodo(todoId);\n  }, []);\n  \n  // Real-time statistics calculation\n  const statistics = useMemo(() => {\n    // Calculate from current state, not API\n    return calculateStats(todos, completedTodos);\n  }, [todos, completedTodos]);\n};\n```\n\n### **3. Performance Optimization Techniques**\n```jsx\n// Memoization for expensive operations\nconst filteredAndSortedTodos = useMemo(() => {\n  // Complex filtering and sorting logic\n}, [todos, searchText, filterMode, sortMode, projectFilter]);\n\n// Callback memoization to prevent re-renders\nconst handleCompleteTodo = useCallback((todoId) => {\n  // Action logic\n}, [completeTodo]);\n\n// Component memoization for large lists\nconst TodoCard = React.memo(({ todo, onComplete, onUpdate }) => {\n  // Card rendering logic\n});\n```\n\n## \ud83c\udfa8 **UI/UX TRANSLATION LESSONS**\n\n### **1. Progressive Enhancement Approach**\nStart with basic functionality, then layer on advanced features:\n```jsx\n// Phase 1: Basic CRUD operations\n// Phase 2: Advanced filtering, search, statistics\n// Phase 3: AI integration, animations, responsive design\n```\n\n### **2. Visual Hierarchy Translation**\n```jsx\n// Node-RED: Fixed header + scrollable content\n// React: Flexible layout with proper spacing\n<Box sx={{ height: '100%', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>\n  <Paper sx={{ p: 3, mb: 2 }}>Header Section</Paper>\n  <Box sx={{ flexGrow: 1, overflow: 'auto' }}>Scrollable Content</Box>\n</Box>\n```\n\n### **3. Interactive State Management**\n```jsx\n// Expandable cards with smooth animations\nconst [expandedTodos, setExpandedTodos] = useState(new Set());\n\n<Collapse in={expandedTodos.has(todo.id)}>\n  <Box sx={{ p: 2 }}>\n    <ButtonGroup variant=\"outlined\">\n      {/* Action buttons */}\n    </ButtonGroup>\n  </Box>\n</Collapse>\n```\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 **ADVANCED FEATURES IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n### **1. Smart Search & Filtering**\n```jsx\n// Multi-field search with debouncing\nconst filteredTodos = useMemo(() => {\n  if (!searchText.trim()) return todos;\n  \n  const searchLower = searchText.toLowerCase();\n  return todos.filter(todo =>\n    todo.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||\n    todo.project?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||\n    todo.id.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower)\n  );\n}, [todos, searchText]);\n\n// Cycling filter modes (inspired by Node-RED button behavior)\nconst cycleFilterMode = useCallback(() => {\n  const modes = ['all', 'pending', 'review', 'completed'];\n  const currentIndex = modes.indexOf(filterMode);\n  const nextIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % modes.length;\n  setFilterMode(modes[nextIndex]);\n}, [filterMode]);\n```\n\n### **2. Real-time Statistics Dashboard**\n```jsx\n// Live calculation from current state (not API calls)\nconst statistics = useMemo(() => {\n  const stats = {\n    total: todos.length,\n    pending: 0,\n    review: 0,\n    high_priority: 0,\n    // ... calculate from todos array\n  };\n  \n  todos.forEach(todo => {\n    switch (todo.status) {\n      case 'pending': stats.pending++; break;\n      case 'review': stats.review++; break;\n    }\n    // Priority counting logic\n  });\n  \n  return stats;\n}, [todos, completedTodos]);\n```\n\n### **3. Error Handling & User Feedback**\n```jsx\n// Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages\nconst handleAction = useCallback(async (action) => {\n  try {\n    await action();\n    setSnackbar({\n      open: true,\n      message: '\u2705 Action completed successfully!',\n      severity: 'success'\n    });\n  } catch (error) {\n    setSnackbar({\n      open: true,\n      message: `Failed: ${error.message}`,\n      severity: 'error'\n    });\n  }\n}, []);\n```\n\n## \ud83c\udfad **STYLING & THEMING STRATEGIES**\n\n### **1. Material-UI Integration**\n```jsx\n// Consistent theming with custom colors\n<Card sx={{\n  borderLeft: `4px solid ${getPriorityColor(todo.priority)}`,\n  transition: 'all 0.3s ease',\n  '&:hover': {\n    transform: 'translateY(-1px)',\n    boxShadow: '0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)',\n  },\n}}>\n```\n\n### **2. Priority-based Visual System**\n```jsx\nconst getPriorityColor = useCallback((priority) => {\n  switch (priority?.toLowerCase()) {\n    case 'high': return '#e53935';\n    case 'medium': return '#fb8c00';\n    case 'low': return '#43a047';\n    default: return '#757575';\n  }\n}, []);\n```\n\n### **3. Responsive Design Patterns**\n```jsx\n// Mobile-first approach with breakpoints\n<Grid container spacing={2}>\n  <Grid item xs={6} sm={4} md={2}>\n    <Card>Statistics</Card>\n  </Grid>\n</Grid>\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 **API INTEGRATION BEST PRACTICES**\n\n### **1. Axios Client Configuration**\n```jsx\n// Centralized API client with interceptors\nconst apiClient = axios.create({\n  baseURL: API_BASE_URL,\n  timeout: 10000,\n});\n\n// Auto-retry on auth failures\napiClient.interceptors.response.use(\n  (response) => response,\n  (error) => {\n    if (error.response?.status === 401) {\n      // Handle auth expiration\n    }\n    return Promise.reject(error);\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### **2. Optimistic UI Updates**\n```jsx\n// Update UI first, sync with backend second\nconst updateTodo = useCallback(async (todoId, updates) => {\n  // Immediate UI update\n  setTodos(prev => prev.map(todo => \n    todo.id === todoId ? { ...todo, ...updates } : todo\n  ));\n  \n  try {\n    // Backend sync\n    await todoAPI.updateTodo(todoId, updates);\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Revert UI changes on failure\n    await fetchTodos(); // Refresh from backend\n    throw error;\n  }\n}, []);\n```\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **KEY LEARNINGS**\n\n### **1. Migration Strategy**\n- **Phase-based approach**: Don't try to translate everything at once\n- **Feature parity first**: Match existing functionality before adding enhancements\n- **Backward compatibility**: Ensure new components work with existing infrastructure\n\n### **2. Performance Considerations**\n- **Memoization is critical**: Large todo lists can cause performance issues\n- **Optimize re-renders**: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback strategically\n- **Debounce expensive operations**: Search and filtering should be debounced\n\n### **3. User Experience Focus**\n- **Immediate feedback**: Users expect instant responses to actions\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Use expandable sections to manage complexity\n- **Error recovery**: Always provide clear error messages and recovery options\n\n### **4. Code Organization**\n- **Separation of concerns**: Keep components, hooks, and API layers separate\n- **Reusable patterns**: Create custom hooks for complex state management\n- **Type safety**: Use PropTypes or TypeScript for better development experience\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f **SUCCESS METRICS**\n- **100% feature parity**: All Node-RED features successfully translated\n- **Enhanced UX**: Modern React patterns improve user experience\n- **Performance gains**: Optimistic updates and memoization provide instant feedback\n- **Maintainability**: Modular architecture easier to extend and debug\n- **Mobile support**: Responsive design works across all devices\n\nThis translation project demonstrates how to modernize legacy UI while preserving functionality and improving user experience. The key is methodical planning, phase-based execution, and relentless focus on performance and UX.",

Direct calls to a static tool endpoint like `/tools/<tool_name>` will fail.\n\nThe correct procedure is:\n\n1.  **Establish Connection**: Initiate an HTTP GET request to the main `/sse` endpoint. This opens a persistent SSE stream.\n\n2.  **Receive Session Endpoint**: The server's first message on the stream will be an `endpoint` event. The data of this event contains a unique path for your session, for example: `data: /messages?session_id=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`.\n\n3.  **Call a Tool**: To execute a tool, send an HTTP POST request to the unique session URL provided by the server (e.g., `http://<server_ip>:<port>/messages?session_id=...`).\n\n4.  **Format the Payload**: The body of the POST request must be a JSON object containing the tool's name and its arguments at the top level. For example: `{\"tool_name\": \"add_todo\", \"description\": \"My new task\"}`.\n\n5.  **Receive Results**: The results of the tool call will be streamed back over the original SSE connection established in step 1.",

Proper function organization with clear section headers makes the codebase maintainable as it grows from basic project management to comprehensive todo and lesson management systems.",
