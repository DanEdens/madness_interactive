# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES FOR MAD SCIENTISTS
*"How to add your insane brilliance to our collective grimoire without causing a catastrophic knowledge explosion!"*

`#contribution` `#guidelines` `#documentation`

## THE MAD SCIENTIST'S OATH

Before contributing to this eldritch collection of knowledge, all practitioners must swear by the following oath:

1. I shall document my experiments, successful or catastrophic
2. I shall follow the formatting rituals to maintain grimoire consistency
3. I shall cross-reference related knowledge to strengthen our neural network
4. I shall use appropriate tags to categorize my contributions
5. I shall update existing documentation when my experiments change reality
6. I shall embrace both method and madness in my documentation

## ADDING NEW KNOWLEDGE

### 1. Choose the Correct Tome

Our grimoire is organized into several categories, each with its own purpose:

- **Arcana**: Architecture and design documents
- **Chronicles**: Changelogs and historical records
- **Experiments**: Current and failed experiments
- **Incantations**: Code patterns and examples
- **Projects**: Project-specific documentation
- **Wisdom**: Lessons learned and insights

Choose the appropriate section for your contribution based on its nature.

### 2. Follow the Document Template

Each document type has a specific template to maintain consistency:

#### Project Documentation Template

```markdown
# PROJECT NAME: TAGLINE
*"Quotation that captures the essence of the project!"*

`#project-tag` `#relevant-tags`

## ESSENCE OF THE PROJECT
Brief overview of what this project is about.

#### Lessons Learned Template

```markdown
### Title of the Lesson
`#relevant-tag` `#another-tag`

Description of the context and problem.

```language
// INCORRECT: Example of incorrect approach
code_example();

// CORRECT: Example of correct approach
better_code_example();
```

**Key Insight**: Concise description of the main lesson learned.
```

### 3. Use Proper Formatting

The grimoire demands specific formatting conventions:

- **Headings**: Use ALL CAPS for top-level headings
- **Quotations**: Include thematic quotations in *italics*
- **Code Blocks**: Always specify the language for syntax highlighting
- **Tags**: Include relevant tags at the top of the document using the `` `#tag` `` format
- **Emojis**: Use emojis to add visual distinction to sections
- **Cross-references**: Link to related documents using relative paths
- **Images**: Include diagrams and visuals where appropriate

### 4. The Tag Taxonomy

When tagging your documents, use our established tag taxonomy:

#### Project Tags
- `#swarmonomicon` - Agent swarm system
- `#omnispindle` - Todo management
- `#hammerspoon` - Window management
- `#cogwyrm` - Mobile MQTT interface
- `#eventghost` - Event automation
- `#tinker` - Testing apparatus

#### Language Tags
- `#rust` - Rust language
- `#python` - Python language
- `#javascript` - JavaScript language
- `#typescript` - TypeScript language
- `#lua` - Lua language
- `#powershell` - PowerShell language

#### Topic Tags
- `#architecture` - System design
- `#agents` - Agent-based systems
- `#mqtt` - Message queue communication
- `#todo` - Task management
- `#testing` - Test methodologies
- `#automation` - Process automation
- `#gui` - Graphical interfaces
- `#mobile` - Mobile development
- `#ai` - Artificial intelligence

## UPDATING EXISTING KNOWLEDGE

### When to Update

Update existing documentation when:
1. Code changes invalidate current documentation
2. You discover errors or inaccuracies
3. You have additional insights to contribute
4. New best practices emerge

### How to Update

1. Locate the relevant document in the grimoire
2. Make your changes while maintaining the existing format
3. Add your new insights or corrections
4. Update the "last modified" date at the top of the document
5. Commit your changes with a descriptive message

## THE REVIEW RITUAL

All contributions undergo a review ritual to ensure quality and consistency:

1. **Clarity Check**: Is the documentation clear and comprehensible?
2. **Format Check**: Does it follow our formatting conventions?
3. **Accuracy Check**: Is the information technically accurate?
4. **Completeness Check**: Does it cover the topic thoroughly?
5. **Cross-Reference Check**: Are links to related documents included?
6. **Tag Check**: Are appropriate tags applied?
7. **Madness Check**: Does it maintain the appropriate level of mad scientist themeing?

## FORBIDDEN PRACTICES

The following practices are forbidden and may result in your contribution being transmuted into a more acceptable form:

1. **Bland, Corporate Language**: Documentation must maintain our mad scientist aesthetic
2. **Excessive Acronyms**: Write for clarity, not brevity
3. **Missing Context**: Don't assume the reader knows what you know
4. **Undescriptive Commit Messages**: Explain why changes were made
5. **Dead Links**: Ensure all cross-references point to existing documents
6. **Duplicated Information**: Update existing documents rather than creating new ones
7. **Insufficient Examples**: Include code examples where relevant
8. **Isolated Knowledge**: Always cross-reference related documents

## UPDATING THE GRIMOIRE STRUCTURE

If you believe the grimoire structure itself needs modification:

1. Create a proposal document in `docs/grimoire/experiments/proposals/`
2. Describe the current issues and your proposed solution
3. Include a migration plan for existing documentation
4. Submit for review by the Mad Council of Documentation
