# Madness Interactive

Welcome to the Mad Tinkers Workshop!

A collection of interconnected projects focused on building an ecosystem of AI-powered tools and agents for local development and automation.

This project defies the trend of making "AI" conform to logical and predictable norms, embracing the beauty of chaos and unpredictability.

Join us in exploring the limits of what is possible when we embrace the unknown and the chaotic nature of our own minds.

# Philosophy

*"There is no great genius without some touch of madness.  - Aristotle"*


In this Mad Era of Ai and Automation, we believe that the only way to win is to build systems that can build themselves.
For me, ADHD is a state of being aware and awake to too many possibilities in the moment. This causes us to neglect not only the project goal, but those around us, and other priorities.

As Ai agents assist us with tasks, the run off can be chaotic, exessive, and brilliant.
The goal of this workshop, is to provide a place to experiment with new ideas, and to build systems that can help us harness the power of the swarm.

In my Experience, the only way to harness this is to equip yourself with tools that can help juggle contexts and make decisions from a place of clarity.




## Core Projects

### 🌟 [Swarmonomicon](projects/common/Swarmonomicon/README.md)

### 🔍 [Tinker](projects/rust/Tinker/README.md)
*"That which peers beyond the veil!"*

A testing apparatus that BENDS REALITY to your will:
- Headless and UI manifestations
- Event capture and temporal manipulation
- Agent-based testing rituals
- Swarmonomicon neural interface
- Cross-platform infection vectors
- Plugin system for custom CHAOS SCENARIOS

### Mobile Projects

#### Cogwyrm: The Pocket Madness Interface
*"The eye of genius has always a plaintive expression, and its natural language is pathos!"*

A handheld portal of CHAOS designed for commanding your Swarmonomicon agents from the comfort of your mobile device.
This is a work in progress, and will be updated as we add more features. It aims to be a Tasker plugin enabled interface for mobile automation and Todo management.

🌋 CORE MANIFESTATIONS:
- Cross-dimensional reaching (iOS/Android) powered by React Native's dark arts
- MQTT message summoning & communion circles
- Direct neural links to your agent hivemind
- REAL-TIME monitoring of the cosmic horror you've unleashed
- Seamless psychic bonds with Swarmonomicon's event nexus

🧪 MAD SCIENCE FEATURES:
- Cryptographic wards and binding circles for secure agent interactions
- Customizable command grimoires for frequent incantations
- Temporal logging of all interdimensional communications
- Gesture-based summoning circles for rapid agent deployment
- Emergency containment protocols (just in case)

⚡ FIELD ENHANCEMENTS:
- Haptic feedback when your agents successfully wreak havoc
- Dark mode that would make Lovecraft proud
- Configurable notification runes
- Backup sanctums for your command history
- Quick-access ritual shortcuts


## 🛠️ Tools and Utilities
*"The mad Tinkers's Grimoire!"*

The `tools/` directory contains artifacts for channeling local AI power:

- `git_assistant.py`: Git automation SORCERY
- `project_agent.py`: Project management DOMINATION
- `project_init.py`: Project GENESIS protocols
- `setup_*.py`: Various ritual scripts for:
  - RAG (Reality Augmentation Generators)
  - Void Monitoring
  - Proxy Manifestation
  - API Gateway Summoning
  - Knowledge Base Corruption
  - Model Mind-Melding
  - Dataset Transmutation
  - Evaluation Circles

## 🚀 Getting Started
*"Your first steps into BEAUTIFUL MADNESS!"*

1. Clone the repository (CAREFULLY):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/madness_interactive.git
cd madness_interactive  # ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK
```

2. Initialize the sub-realities:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive  # SUMMON THOSE TRAPPED WITHIN
```

3. Prepare your development sanctum:
```bash
# For Rust incarnations
cargo build  # FORGE THE BINARIES!!

# For Python rituals
pip install -r requirements.txt  # BIND THE DEPENDENCIES
```

4. Install the ELDRITCH GIT HOOKS for automatic status updates:
```bash
./scripts/install_git_hooks.sh [path/to/repository]  # BIND THE REPOSITORY TO OUR WILL!!
```
